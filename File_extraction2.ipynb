It is evident that the West, especially America,\\nmisjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and \\nthreatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world\\'s\\noil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been\\nprevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West\\nbefore Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is\\nresponsible for his decision to invade.  And once he did so, a\\nstrong response from the West was required.\\n\\n> \\n>> Mathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here.\\n>> You come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I\\n>> feel sure that was not your intent.\\n> \\n> What\\'s your intent?

It is precisely the lessons the world learned\\nin WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.

In sum, Ezekiel prophesied\\nthat the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of\\npeople living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct.\\n\\nThis doesn\\'t bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used\\ndifferently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimes\\nhappens that someone says \"My grandson is the cutest baby!\" and then turns\\naround and sees the granddaughter and says \"Oh!  Isn\\'t she the cutest thing!?\"\\n\\nThis person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the\\nworld according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for\\nfirst.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very\\nobject-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people,\\nnobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is\\noften at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly\\nliterally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me,\\nit is not.\\n\\n\\nTurning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from\\nJohn E King:\\n\\n> The prophesy clearly implies that people would still be living in the\\n> area[.]\\n\\nNo, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from\\nEzekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say\\n\"Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff\\nlike that.\"  You would read \"I will make you a bare rock\" and \"You will never\\nbe rebuilt\", and you\\'d conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way\\nto get from `fishing nets\\' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large\\npopulation\\' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.\\n\\nIn other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the\\nprophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal\\nreading, they could read this passage and conclude \"medium-size city\".\\n\\nYou seem to feel that \"Never be rebuilt\" means \"be rebuilt\" -- maybe so, but\\nit is hardly a `clear implication\\'.\\n\\n\\nMr King also writes:\\n\\n> So far I\\'ve seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 to 22,000.\\n> Let\\'s assume the latter one is correct.  By modern standards\\n> we are talking about a one-horse town.\\n\\nWell, no.  That\\'s only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I\\'m\\nfrom.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington\\nresigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but\\nit\\'s at least a two-horse town.\\n\\nBut supposing 22,000 people is a \"small town\" -- it\\'s still 22,000 people\\nMORE than Ezekiel predicted.\\n\\n\\nAnd you\\'ve said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel\\npredicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their\\nvaluables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29\\nEzekiel even quotes God as saying \"he and his army got no reward from the\\ncampaign he led against Tyre.\"\\n\\nLet\\'s ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26.\\nEzekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says\\nthat N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.\\n\\nRegardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before\\nthe place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.\\n\\n *\\n\\nThis post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability\\nto rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.\\n\\nFor example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26\\nby pulling some \"clear implications\" out of hat.\\n\\nWhen Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your towers\", that clearly implied\\nthat the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers\\nused to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your fine houses\\nand throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea\", that clearly implied\\nthat N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N.\\nwould \"build a ramp up to your walls\", that clearly implies that N. would\\nspend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the\\nwalls.\\n\\nSee?  A few \"clear implications\" that are totally contrary to the text, and\\nyou can reconcile anything you want.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\"[Do] You know why I\\'m the enabler?

Schmidt)\\nSubject: outlining of spline surface\\nKeywords: spline rasterization\\nLines: 38\\n\\n\\n\\tAbout a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to\\nbe very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if\\nanyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published \\nsolutions to it.\\n\\n\\tThe problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two\\nroughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially\\nstarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the \\nedge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant\\nbetween the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw \\nthe object we \\n\\n1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively\\n\\tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the\\n        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume\\n\\tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not\\n\\texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable\\n\\tmeasure.\\n2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment\\n\\tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two\\n\\ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface.\\n3) Depth sort the triangles\\n4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw\\n\\tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is\\n\\talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge\\n\\tcolored with a special \"edge color\"\\n\\n\\tIt is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the\\nproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.\\nThe net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in\\nthe edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.\\nThey involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting\\nfrom the projecting the splines.

Our agency started to express interest in\\n|> virtual reality(VR).  So far, we do not know much about VR.  All we\\n|> know about are the Hollywood movies \"The Terminater 2\" and \"Lawnmover\\n|> Man\".  We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and\\n|> Computer Graphics World magazine.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n|> \\n|> We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading\\n|> companies,\\n|> agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4,\\n|> HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI\\'s uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\\n\\n\\n|>  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR\\n|> (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?\\n\\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

As his guilt has not been established, it is\\nwrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.\\n\\n(b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps\\nhave not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is\\n_not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and\\n_in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important \\ndistinction.\\n\\nI should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say \"Muslim\".  In\\ngeneral, anyone who calls themselves a \"Muslim\" and does not do or \\noutwardly profess\\nsomething in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam\\nis considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to\\nIslam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a\\nMuslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential\\nprinciples, though, then one does leave Islam.\\n\\nThe term \"Muslim\" is to be contrasted with \"Mu\\'min\", which means \"true\\nbeliever\".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu\\'min is\\nsomething known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you\\nwill not find the term Mu\\'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism,\\nbecause it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I,\\nfor example, am a \"true believer\" or not.  For example, I could just be\\nputting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to\\nwhat I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say \"Muslims\"\\nwe mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in\\npractice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By\\n\"Muslim\" we do not necessarily mean \"Mu\\'min\", or \"true believer\" in\\nIslam.\\n\\n Fred Rice\\n darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au   \\n\\n',\n",

Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye \\n          cannot hear my word.  Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the \\n          lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the \\n          beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in \\n          him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a \\n          liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)\\n\\n          And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of \\n          the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease \\n          to pervert the right ways of the Lord? (Acts 13:10)\\n\\n          Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this \\n          world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit \\n          that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (Ephesians 2:2)\\n\\n          In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the \\n          devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he \\n          that loveth not his brother.

The fact that some groups try to read \\n     something into the Bible, doesn\\'t change what the Bible teaches. For \\n     example, the fact that the Jehovah\\'s Witnesses deny the Deity of Christ \\n     does not alter what the Bible teaches [ \"Looking for that blessed hope,\\n     and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus\\n     Christ;\" (Titus 2:13),\"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus\\n     Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through\\n     the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:\" (2 Peter 1:1)] \\n     on the Deity of Christ.\\n\\n     We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not \\n     even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that \\n     have differing views is self-defeating. To see what the Bible teaches, \\n     you have to look at the Bible.\\n\\nra> >     \"Our Lord\\'s mortality was essential to his own salvation\" (_The\\nra> >     Promised Messiah_, p. 456), \"He had to work out his own salvation by\\nra> >     doing the will of the Father in all things\" (ibid., p.54), \"he had\\nra> >     to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom\" (_Mormon\\nra> >     Doctrine_, p.71).\\nra>\\nra>    Welcome to the wonderful world of Mormon paradoctrine, Robert.

The curious part is that no one addressed the\\n     issue of `Jesus needing to be saved.\\' Rick comes the closest with his \"I\\n     have my own conclusions\" to addressing the point.\\n\\n     Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of\\n     Bruce McConkie and whether his views were \\'official doctrine.\\' I don\\'t\\n     think that it matters if McConkie\\'s views were canon. That is not the\\n     issue.  Were McConkie\\'s writings indicative of Mormon belief on this\\n     subject is the real issue.

UK.\\nSupersedes: <19930322114724@mantis.co.uk>\\nLines: 632\\n\\nArchive-name: atheism/logic\\nAlt-atheism-archive-name: logic\\nLast-modified: 5 April 1993\\nVersion: 1.4\\n\\n                       Constructing a Logical Argument\\n\\nAlthough there is much argument on Usenet, the general quality of argument\\nfound is poor.  This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\\n\\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\\nargument.\\n\\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\\nthe right tool for the job.\\n\\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"It is\\nraining\" or \"Today is Tuesday\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\\nof \"deny\", not the everyday meaning.\\n\\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\\narrangement of words used to express it.  So \"God exists\" and \"There exists a\\nGod\" both express the same proposition.\\n\\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connected series of\\nstatements to establish a definite proposition\".  An argument consists of\\nthree stages.\\n\\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \\n\\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\",\\n\"since\", \"obviously\" and so on.  (The phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with\\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\\npremises.  If something doesn\\'t seem obvious to you, don\\'t be afraid to\\nquestion it.  You can always say \"Oh, yes, you\\'re right, it is obvious\" when\\nyou\\'ve heard the explanation.)\\n\\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\\nvalid inference.\\n\\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or\\n\"therefore\".\\n\\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\\nindicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\"\\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\\n\\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\\n\\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \\nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \\nsometimes a little confusing.\\n\\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\\n\\n\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\\n or the Son of God.\"\\n\\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \\nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we\\'ll\\ncome to those later.)\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\n\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\\n\\nThe phrase \"do your duty to God\" is not a proposition, since it is neither\\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\\nargument.\\n\\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \"A because\\nB\".  If we\\'re interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\\nstatement is an argument.  If we\\'re trying to establish the truth of B, then\\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\\n start.\" -- This is an argument.\\n\\n\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\"\\n -- This is an explanation.\\n\\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\\nconclusion is true.\\n\\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\\n\\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \\ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\\ncarefully.\\n\\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \\nFor example:\\n\\n   All insects have wings (premise)\\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\\n\\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument\\'s premises are false. \\nIf the argument\\'s premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \\nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\\n\\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\\nas in:\\n\\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\\n\\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\\nimplication.\\n\\nThe symbol \"=>\" denotes implication; \"A\" is the premise, \"B\" the conclusion. \\n\"T\" and \"F\" represent true and false respectively.\\n\\nPremise Conclusion Inference\\n   A        B        A=>B\\n----------------------------\\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\\n\\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\\n\\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\\n                             the conclusion must be true.\\n\\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \\nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\\n\\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\\n\\nIn everyday English the term \"fallacy\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\\nconvincing.\\n\\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\\nexhaustive.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\\n\\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \"might makes right\". \\nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\\n\\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally \"argument directed at the man\".\\n\\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\"\\n\\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \\nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness\\'s\\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\\n\\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\\nthe opponent\\'s particular circumstances.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\\notherwise when you\\'re quite happy to wear leather shoes?\"\\n\\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\\nthe opponent\\'s argument.\\n\\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \\nYou\\'re white.\"\\n\\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one\\'s\\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\\nalso known as \"poisoning the well\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\\n\\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means \"argument from ignorance\".  This fallacy\\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\"\\n\\n\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\\nshown any proof that they are real.\"\\n\\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\\n\\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \\nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\\n\\n\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\\nsuch flood occurred.\"\\n\\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\\nhowever.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\\n\\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \\ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \\nconclusion accepted.  For example:\\n\\n\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don\\'t find me\\nguilty; I\\'m suffering enough through being an orphan.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\\n\\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\\n\\n\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\"\\n\\n\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\\n\\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\\n\\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\\n\\n\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\"\\n\\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\\nbetween:\\n\\n\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\"\\nand\\n\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\\n computer\"\\n\\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \\nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\\n\\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\\n\\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular case whose \"accidental\" circumstances mean that the rule is\\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\\nspecific.  For example:\\n\\n\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\\ndislike atheists.\"\\n\\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\\n\\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\\n\\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\\ninsincere.\"\\n\\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\\n\\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\\nhasty generalization.\\n\\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\\n\\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\\ncured me of the headache.\"\\n\\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\\natheism for the same reasons.\"\\n\\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\\n\\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\\nconclusion reached.\\n\\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \\nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\\noffice.\"\\n\\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \\nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\\nfor the British Secret Services\\' official ban on homosexual employees. \\nAnother example is the classic:\\n\\n\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\\nBible is true because it is the word of God.\"\\n\\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\\n\\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \\nquestion:\\n\\n\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\"\\n\\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\\nwhen they ask questions like:\\n\\n\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\"\\n\\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\\n\\n\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\"\\nor\\n\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\"\\n\\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\\n\\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \\nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\\nwith that conclusion.\\n\\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\\n\\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\\nfavourable light.\\n\\nEQUIVOCATION\\n\\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\"\\n\\nAMPHIBOLY\\n\\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\\n\\nACCENT\\n\\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\\n\\n\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\"\\nand\\n\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\"\\n\\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\\n\\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\\n\\n\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \\nlightweight.\"\\n\\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\\n\\n\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\\nare less environmentally damaging than buses.\"\\n\\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\\n\\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\\n\\n\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\"\\n\\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\\neach item.  For example:\\n\\n\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\"\\n\\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\\n\\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\\nfirst event.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\\nand we\\'ll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\\nlegalize marijuana.\"\\n\\n\"A IS BASED ON B\" FALLACIES / \"IS A TYPE OF\" FALLACIES\\n\\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Isn\\'t history based upon faith?  If so, then isn\\'t the Bible also a form of\\nhistory?\"\\n\\n\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn\\'t Islam a\\nform of Christianity?\"\\n\\n\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren\\'t dogs a form of cat?\"\\n\\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, B is true, therefore A\\nis true\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\\nimplication given earlier.\\n\\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B\\nis false\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\\na fallacy.\\n\\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\\nthe form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\", where A does NOT in\\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\\nanything about B.\\n\\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"If A then B, therefore if B then A\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\\n\\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\\nbecause it is old, or because \"that\\'s the way it\\'s always been.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\\n\\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\\nthan something else.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\\n\\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\\n\\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\\nargumentum ad crumenam.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\\n\\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\\nmore often it is heard.  An \"argumentum ad nauseum\" is one that employs\\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\\n\\nBIFURCATION\\n\\nAlso referred to as the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\\nalternatives exist or can exist.\\n\\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\\nquestion.\\n\\nNON SEQUITUR\\n\\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\\n\\nRED HERRING\\n\\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\\nbeing discussed, so that everyone\\'s attention is diverted away from the\\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\\n\\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\\n\\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\\n\\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\\n\\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\\n\\nSTRAW MAN\\n\\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else\\'s position so that it\\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\\nmade.\\n\\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\\n\\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \\ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \\nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\\n\\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \\nanti-cryptography legislation:\\n\\n\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\"\\n\\n\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\\n Martin Luther King.\"\\n\\n\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\"\\n\\nTU QUOQUE\\n\\nThis is the famous \"you too\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\\n\\n\"You\\'re just being randomly abusive.\"\\n\"So?  You\\'ve been abusive too.\"\\n\\nÿ\\n',\n",

Up comes the pagan King of Persia, Cyrus.  Up comes\\nNehemiah, cupbearer to the King of Persia.  Then Matthew, an IRS agent\\ntakes the stand.  Up comes Luke, an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who use\\nto kill Christians for fun.  Up comes John, a 17 year old boy.  Up\\ncomes Peter, a fishermen.  Up comes James, the brother of Jesus himself.\\nUp comes hundreds of others.  You hear testimony from fishermen, IRS\\nagents, priests, Kings.  The court hearing lasts thousands of years\\nwith people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself\\n\"I am.\" \\n\\nWhile you are listening to all this stuff, you realize that\\nKing David could have never known John, Solomon could have never known\\nMatthew, Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all these\\npeople are independent witnesses, and so, you rule out collaboration.  Yet\\nall of the witnesses tell of the same God.   Each testifier tells\\nof his own experiences with the living God.  Each experience is\\ndifferent, but each experience has enough cross-over to unmistakenly\\nreveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God.\\nWhat Daniel did not know about God, the 3rd Highest Official of\\nBabylon, God revealed to John 600 years later--but with a different\\nperspective.  No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimony\\ndares to venture off what is already known.  Yet each witness\\'s\\ntestimony, even though different from those prior, consistently\\ndescribes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God.  \\n\\nNow.  As we stare gazing at the computer, you got this seeming fanatic\\non the other end of the net, saying, I know this God  \"I am\".  He has\\nrevealed himself to me too.  He also calls himself Jesus (John 8:58).\\nPlease believe me.  I am telling the truth.  It is wonderful to know him.\\n\\nAre you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness? \\nAre you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from\\nshepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computer\\nprogrammers, fiction?  With a scoff of your keyboard, with near\\ncomplete ignorance of the testimonies, are you going to say that\\nthat is all complete hooey?   Would that not be the most audacious\\ndisplay of arrogance?  Do you actually think you know better than\\nKing Solomon, King David, or even Abraham Lincolnr?\\n',\n",

Hiermee ontstond de tweede\\nuniversiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste\\nwaarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde\\nin de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de\\nvoorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350\\njaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.\\n\\nDe huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten\\nsterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht,\\nvieren de benoeming van hun \\'oervader\\' middels een breed scala\\naan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een\\nplanetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal\\nvoordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies\\nNatalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er\\nstaat echter meer op stapel.\\n\\nStudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een\\nsterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het\\nsymposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het\\nhuidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten\\n\\'compacte objecten\\', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.\\nBij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de\\ndeelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van\\nde stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de\\neerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een\\nbeknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren,\\nwaarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een\\nhalf uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten\\nzullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot\\nhet stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op\\neen apart vel.\\nHet niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars\\nstudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN\\nZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!\\n\\nTijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed\\ngaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht\\nWesterbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen\\nhet heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van\\neen snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar,\\nin de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren.\\nProf. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel\\nopvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en\\ntrachten te verklaren.\\nHet slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de\\ntechnische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn\\nnamelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10\\nmiljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30\\nWatt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal\\ner niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse\\ntechnologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.\\n\\nDeelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en\\nf 16,- (inclusief lunch).

Massive amounts of regolith would\\nhave to be processed.\\n\\nThis thread reminds me of Wingo\\'s claims some time ago about the moon\\nas a source of titanium for use on earth.

This is nice, but...\\nterrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in\\ntitanium.

These flood basalts are\\n*enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the\\nworld (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If\\neven 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2\\nat concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti\\nbasalts.

I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning\\nahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune\\nsystem that was not, at the time of design, necessary?

Unlike the conventional large \\nVHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed \\nto individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier \\nfeeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast \\nbeam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the \\nantenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal \\ndivision/combination are performed at a low signal level using \\nelectronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna \\nbeam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the \\nzenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element \\nis crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful \\ncalibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna \\nelement was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for \\nthis purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to \\nmake a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern \\nmonitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific \\nsatellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna \\nMonitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 \\nwatts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement \\nand results are discussed.\\n\\n\\nEquatorial radar system\\nFUKAO, SHOICHIRO;  TSUDA, TOSHITAKA; SATO, TORU; KATO, SUSUMU\\n(Kyoto University, Uji, Japan)\\n(COSPAR, IAGA, SCOSTEP, et al., Plenary Meeting, 27th,\\nWorkshops and Symposium on the Earth's Middle Atmosphere,\\nEspoo, Finland, July 18-29, 1988) Advances in Space Research\\n(ISSN 0273-1177), vol. 10, no. 10, 1990, p. 151-154.\\n     A large clear air radar with the sensitivity of an incoherent \\nscatter radar for observing the whole equatorial atmosphere up to 1000 \\nkm altitude is now being designed in Japan. The radar will be built in \\nPontianak, West Kalimantan, Indonesia (0.03 deg N, 109.29 deg E). The \\nsystem is a 47-MHz monostatic Doppler radar with an active phased array \\nconfiguration similar to that of the MU radar in Japan, which has been \\nin successful operation since 1983. It will have a PA product of about \\n3 x 10 to the 9th W sq m (P = average transmitter power, A = effective \\nantenna aperture) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 times that of \\nthe MU radar. This system configuration enables pulse-to-pulse beam \\nsteering within 20 deg from the zenith. As is the case of the MU radar, \\na variety of operations will be made feasible under the supervision of \\nthe radar controller. A brief description of the system configuration \\nis presented. \\n\\n\",\n",

A set of rules is a moral code or a\\n> law code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful\\n> to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a\\n> personal involvement in and responsibility for one\\'s actions. ...\\n\\nThe two commandments *are* rules; they are merely rules that are\\nso vague that they are practically devoid of meaning.  Michael\\nSiemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution\\nof an argument over them turns on secular and cultural\\nassumptions that are independent of these rules.\\n \\n> ... The Great  Commandment is, more than anything else, a call\\n> to act *as if you were God and accepting ultimate responsibility*\\n> in your every action. ...\\n\\nThe commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed,\\nin part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if\\nhe has \"ultimate responsibility.\" Indeed, many traditions present\\nan interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret\\nloving one\\'s neighbor as following various other rules, and\\nrelying on their god to make things come out right, precisely\\nbecause it would be wrong for man to assume such \"ultimate\\nresponsibility.\" Once again, we are confronted with good sounding\\ngoo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean. \\n\\n> ... \"Conservatives\" may twist this \"act as if you were God\" to \\n> mean \"lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them\\n> as possible if they don\\'t keep YOUR rules.\"  They are so\\n> insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a\\n> lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such \\n> idiocy IS how God acts. ...\\n\\nAnd who is to say that this interpretation is \"twisted\"?  There\\nare many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward\\nreading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.\\nMichael cannot refer to \"base\" claims or base commandments to\\nshow that such readings are \"twisted,\" because this divergence in\\nunderstanding occurs even in trying to interpret the \"base\"\\nclaims and commandments.  In addressing conservative Christians,\\nMichael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions\\nthat these conservative Christians will reject.  \\n\\n> But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our\\n> society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It\\n> may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems\\n> -- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.\\n\\nBut these base commandments are too vague to serve as  \"a\\nprinciple for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems.\" The meaning of\\nthese base commandments for any believer derives from the secular\\nand cultural notions that the believer brings to them, from how\\nthe believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of\\nother Biblical passages, from a particular sectarian tradition,\\nor from some combination of these things.  These commandments\\nlack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for\\ncriticizing ethical systems.  What meaning they have comes from\\nthe ethical system the believer brings to these commandments. \\n\\n> And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged\\n> *different* \"ethical systems\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,\\n> it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular\\n> (or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.\\n> It does not have a QU\\'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very\\n> little, if anything, in the way of \"commandments\" -- so little that\\n> the \"Christians\" who desperately *want* commandments go \"mining\" for\\n> them with almost no support ... The one, single, thing in the gospels\\n> which Jesus specifically \"gives\" as \"a commandment\" to us is \"love\\n> one another.\"\\n\\nJesus explicitly states that this summarizes Jewish law, which\\nwould seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what\\nit means to love God and love our neighbors.  There are *many*\\nparables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that are\\nstraightforwardly read as ethical commandments.  The Pauline\\nepistles are similarly full.  If it is not clear that these all\\ncome together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior,\\nthe problem is *not* a lack of raw material. \\n\\n-*----\\n> I am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\\n\\nNo, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel \\nseriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the\\ngospel.\\n\\n> ... Why don\\'t I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me\\n> tell you something about Christianity? ...\\n\\nIn a sense, the wide variety of interpretations does tell us\\nsomething about Christianity.  It tells us that the New Testament\\nauthors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve\\nas the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about the\\nnature of the Christian god and about what men should and\\nshouldn\\'t do. \\n\\nThe irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per\\nse that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and\\ngays.  *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause is\\neffective only through the extra-Christian principles through\\nwhich Michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes apply\\nthe *same* Christian principles, with equal justification, to\\ntheir cause.  In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that\\nmake Michael\\'s Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would\\nbe as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by\\nChristian interpretation.  \\n\\nMichael paints a picture of \"standard American atheism\" as the\\nrejection of the evil in many conservative Christian\\ninterpretations of the Bible.  But I think it is even more\\ndamaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents\\nsuch a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God and\\nthe nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered by\\nan interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).  Here, I\\nthink we should apply a Christian parable, where a cold drink can\\nhave its value and a hot drink can have its value, but the\\nlukewarm we should spit out. \\n\\nRussell\\n',\n",

Gain values\\n\\t    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are\\n\\t    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8).

In contrast, gain values 50-100\\n\\t    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer\\n\\t    \"high-thrust\" flight capability. One performance example shows a\\n\\t    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with\\n\\t    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle.

If plasma\\n\\t    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds\\n\\t    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities\\n\\t    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and\\n\\t    other special applications would be at hand.

My impression would\\n  be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and\\n  getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a\\n  good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't\\n  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are\\n  well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.

It\\'s more likely that the Moon will never\\nbe the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no\\nmaterials we can\\'t get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids\\nand comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low\\ngrade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, \\nand it\\'s position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it\\'s heat \\nsink capacity could offer some military utility for \"high ground\" military\\nweapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space \\ntravel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as \\nMt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that\\'s a very minor \\nactivity in the global scope of things.\\n\\nLuna has an inconvienent gravity field. It\\'s likely too low to prevent\\ncalcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it\\'s\\ntoo high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories\\nthat can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna\\nhas a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital\\nsites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers\\na source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,\\nand shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and\\nheavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity\\nwells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.\\n\\nWe don\\'t use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually\\nignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That\\'s because we don\\'t have to\\ndeal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more\\nexpensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we\\'ll use the\\neasier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few\\ncenturies, if not much longer.\\n\\nLuna\\'s main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio\\nastronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site\\nof a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for\\ndefending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is\\nunlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.\\nThe second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good\\nenough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for\\nconventional warfare again.

It depends\\non what origins we are talking about.\\n\\n3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins\\nis to say that there is no higher truth than science.\\n\\nAgain, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \"higher\\ntruth\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways\\nto ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even\\nbelieve that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many\\nbelieve that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language\\nof science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \"higher\" or \\n\"lower\"; they are simply true.\\n\\nMore to the point, restricting one\\'s discussion of origins to science\\ndoes not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the\\nscope of discussion.\\n\\n4) This is a false premise.\\n\\nIf this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false\\nthen (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another\\nfalse [or at least theologically unsound] statement.\\n\\n5) By the way, I enjoy science.\\n\\nOn the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science\\nto enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say\\nthat one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read.\\nHowever one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy,\\nperhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.\\n\\n6) It is truly a wonder observing God\\'s creation.\\n\\nLet us not quibble; count this one as true.\\n\\n7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent\\nreligion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]\\n\\nStill another false statement.  However one can make it come out true\\nwith the following contextual modification:\\n\\n\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent\\nof what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of\\nwhat Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\"\\n\\n-----\\n\\nIt is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch\\non truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do\\nhim the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his\\npersonal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that\\nhe has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.\\n-- \\nRichard Harter: SMDS Inc.

Matthew\\n    Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on\\n    Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material\\n    posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).\\n\\nUS PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n\\n    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\\n\\n    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed\\n    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground\\n    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the\\n    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in\\n    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the\\n    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed\\n    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a\\n    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted\\n    from the expression \"R-dot-bar sub n\" (nth smoothed value of derivative\\n    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations\\n    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.\\n\\n    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December\\n    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a\\n    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world\\n    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide\\n    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).\\n\\n    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective\\n    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary\\n    space. Unable to collect the Sun\\'s energy for power from its solar\\n    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in\\n    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.\\n\\n    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and\\n    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it\\n    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere\\n    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from\\n    this preliminary scan that Mars was a \"dead\" world in both the\\n    geological and biological sense.\\n\\n    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that\\n    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information\\n    that Venus\\' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times\\n    that of Earth\\'s, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface\\n    of an ocean.\\n\\n    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work\\n    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away\\n    the concept of Mars as a \"dead\" planet, first made from the basic\\n    measurements of MARINER 4.\\n\\n    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket\\n    launcher autopilot failed.\\n\\n    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to\\n    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no\\n    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian\\n    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once\\n    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup\\n    images of Mars\\' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.\\n\\n    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe\\n    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in\\n    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,\\n    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four\\n    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974\\n    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed\\n    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than\\n    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which\\n    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.\\n\\n\\n    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\\n\\n    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph\\n    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide\\n    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new\\n    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft\\n    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on\\n    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.\\n\\n    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first\\n    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally\\n    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead\\n    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to\\n    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6\\n    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,\\n    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would\\n    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.\\n\\n    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER\\n    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to\\n    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through\\n    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever\\n    to do so.\\n\\n    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER\\n    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made\\n    the first radar studies of the planet\\'s surface via probe. PIONEER Venus\\n    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere\\n    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the\\n    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the\\n    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day\\n    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before\\n    its batteries failed.\\n\\n\\n    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)\\n\\n    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They\\n    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems\\n    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.\\n\\n    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an\\n    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the\\n    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.\\n    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the\\n    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.\\n\\n    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but\\n    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,\\n    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.\\n\\n    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost\\n    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon\\n    and drifted off into solar orbit.\\n\\n    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send\\n    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact\\n    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras\\n    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first\\n    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.\\n\\n\\n    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)\\n\\n    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image\\n    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO\\n    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our\\n    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.\\n    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were\\n    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.\\n    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar\\n    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.\\n\\n\\n    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)\\n\\n    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar\\n    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the\\n    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered\\n    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing\\n    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was\\n    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.\\n\\n    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the\\n    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images\\n    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from\\n    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,\\n    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored\\n    the Tycho crater region in 1968.\\n\\n\\n    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)\\n\\n    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on\\n    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June\\n    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse\\n    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for\\n    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes\\n    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of\\n    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars\\' sky was\\n    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is\\n    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the\\n    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and\\n    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.\\n\\n    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran\\n    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a\\n    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep\\n    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command\\n    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until\\n    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the\\n    engineers\\' efforts through May of 1983.\\n\\n    An interesting side note: VIKING 1\\'s lander has been designated the\\n    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the\\n    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,\\n    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until\\n    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.\\n\\n    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit\\n    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in\\n    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its\\n    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording\\n    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in\\n    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut\\n    down on April 12, 1980.\\n\\n    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.\\n\\n\\n    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)\\n\\n    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March\\n    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched\\n    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,\\n    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and\\n    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare\\n    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to\\n    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,\\n    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.\\n\\n    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their\\n    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered\\n    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and\\n    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major\\n    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous\\n    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.\\n\\n    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets\\n    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep\\n    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive\\n    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle\\n    is known). Titan\\'s atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas\\' appearance was\\n    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.\\n    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,\\n    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.\\n\\n    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,\\n    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly\\n    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was\\n    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational\\n    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on\\n    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10\\n    satellites and one more ring were discovered.\\n\\n    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,\\n    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright\\n    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were\\n    discovered. Neptune\\'s magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a\\n    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What\\'s liquid at 38K?)\\n\\n    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their\\n    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets\\n    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the\\n    location of the heliopause.\\n\\n\\nSOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and\\n    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES\\n\\n    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first\\n\\t     craft in solar orbit.\\n    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.\\n    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.\\n    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3.

The probe did\\n\\t       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week\\n\\t       before scheduled Phobos landing.\\n\\n    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even\\n    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have\\n    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,\\n    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a\\n    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been\\n    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now\\n    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their\\n    space program remains to be seen.\\n\\n\\nJAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on\\n    January 8 1985, and approached Halley\\'s Comet within about 7 million km\\n    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to\\n    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of\\n    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on\\n    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth\\'s. The closest\\n    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The\\n    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for\\n    a Japanese spacecraft.\\n\\n    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail\\n    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby\\n    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth\\'s radius)), and the third\\n    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).\\n\\n\\n    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,\\n    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten\\n    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first\\n    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget\\n    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to\\n    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.\\n\\n    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An\\n    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists\\n    to lose track of it. Hagoromo\\'s rocket motor fired on schedule on March\\n    19, but the spacecraft\\'s tracking transmitter failed immediately. The\\n    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt\\n    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.\\n\\n    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and\\n    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth\\'s atmosphere. Hiten\\n    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,\\n    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon\\'s surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and\\n    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into\\n    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the\\n    approach:\\n\\n\\tApoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km\\n\\tPeriapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km\\n\\tInclination\\t: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)\\n\\tPeriod\\t\\t: 4.7 days\\n\\n\\nPLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES\\n\\n    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three\\n    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,\\n    and periodical sources on space probes.

They still arm themselves to \"defend the\\n#>faith\", and stockpile food as well.  They have been involved in quite a\\n#>lot of illegal activity - including multiple (and often underage) wives\\n#>for the leaders - a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their\\n#>sect.  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.\\n#                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBy \"they,\" you mean the leaders of the lds church?  I grant you that when\\nJoseph Smith was still alive, plenty of \"accusations\" were filed, most of\\nwhich had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts.\\nI have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove\\nthat the lds leadership was involved, in quote: \"illegal activities.\"\\nPlural marriage, yes, but your charge of \"underage\" wives sounds like it\\ncould have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral\\nstandards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it\\nappears, those of David Koresh.\\n\\n#        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram\\n#were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over\\n#who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like\\n#Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider\\n#Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I\\'m led to understand.  Make\\n#no mistake, this was no messiah we\\'re talking about in Smith).  The\\n\\nAnd neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral\\naptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have\\nnothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only \"crime\"\\nwas that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried\\nto explain the \"Smith phenomenon\" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5\\nmillion member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith\\'s\\ntestimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.\\n\\n#thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed\\n#down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only\\n#entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have\\n#been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The\\n#Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn\\'t of much help\\n#here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.\\n#Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited\\n#for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other\\n#claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)\\n\\n\"The rest\" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church,\\nwhile the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various\\nauxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new\\nprophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and\\ndoctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in\\nline to fill the prophet Joseph Smith\\'s vacancy: he was the senior\\napostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated\\nthat it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.\\n\\nOther rightful \"heirs\" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated\\n(Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,\\nJoseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty\\nland beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This\\n\"Rekhabite\" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated\\nby the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.\\n\\nGranted, a couple of \"do-it-yourselfers\" stayed behind, unwilling to\\nsacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but\\nthis also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The\\nchurch benefitted from this purification process: they became even\\nmore unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.\\n\\n#        Both sects practiced the \"1-year food stockpile\" doctrine,\\n#and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at\\n#least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a\\n#militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than\\n#face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a\\n#great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite\\n#justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,\\n#this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people\\n#had nobody to turn to save themselves.\\n#\\n#        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.\\n\\nBTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of\\nthe largest denominations in the country) a \"sect\"???  It didn\\'t \"splinter\"\\nfrom any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.\\n\\n#>So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very\\n#>impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They\\'re pledged to defend\\n#>secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actually\\n#>do - even to the point of suicide.)\\n\\nWhat a balloney.  Suicide is sinful and against the law of God.  I am\\nnot comfortable with this alleged \"cosiness\" with Mammon: I assure you\\nthat *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.  Our\\nONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He has\\nappointed to represent Him.  In any regard, to read this TRASH (about\\nsuicide and \"atone for sins with blood\") is yet another insulting\\nmisrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for...\\n\\n#\\n#        The RLDS, the Reorganized LDS, are friendly rivals of the LDS\\n#and delight in telling stories about them, which generates quick retorts\\n#from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time.  At no time have\\n#I ever even heard this hinted at.  I\\'m taking it with a salt block.\\n\\nMake it a really big salt mountain with a glacier on top.\\n\\n#>  So he hired virtually no one but\\n#>Mormons, until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the\\n#>Church of Later Day Saints.  Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBI\\n#>personnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon.\\n#>I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI\\'s treatment\\n#>of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.\\n\\nPreposterous.  Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I\\nam convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes\\nof honor and conduct (that\\'s why they were selected for in the\\nfirst place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith\\nSTRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all\\npeople are free to worship \"*how*, *where*, or *what* they may.\"\\n\\n#        If it\\'s true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS\\n#philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true\\n#Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his\\n#own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may\\n#as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You\\n#can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected\\n#it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to\\n#Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they\\n#will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover\\n#liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade\\n#alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.\\n#These people are the \"salt of the Earth\" and as such are more\\n#easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.\\n\\nA good explanation, I can accept that.  You are right that lds people\\nare sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon\\'s \"orders\" (the late\\npresident Kimball, for example, was an exception with his strong\\nopposition of the selection of the MX \"Peace Keeper\" missile maze\\nin Utah).\\n\\n#        That\\'s my somewhat educated guess, anyway.  Both sects have\\n#splinter groups that don\\'t mirror the masses, but these are small\\n#and rare, and hardly worth noting their common ancestry.\\n#\\n#        None of this has any relevance to guns, though.

In fact, JPL is actively\\ninvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three\\nimportant ways,\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on\\nthe balloon research campaign.  \\n\\n     \"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\" he\\ncontinued.  \"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,\\nand the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth\\nfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own\\nright.\"\\n\\n     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more\\npieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the\\nmid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. \\nUnderstanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps\\nscientists construct more accurate computer models which are\\ninstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.\\n\\n     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL\\ninstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures\\nozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;\\na submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave\\nradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier\\ntransform infrared interferometer which monitors how the\\natmosphere absorbs sunlight. \\n\\n     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-\\nhour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130\\nkilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground\\nstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.\\nPacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded\\nto separate from the balloon.\\n\\n     \"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared\\nmeasurements,\" Margitan explained, \"and we also needed to fly in\\ndarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\"\\n\\n     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the\\ncompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forward\\ntheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space\\nFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS\\nscientists.    \\n\\n     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon\\nFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a\\ncontract from NASA\\'s Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was\\nlaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction\\nand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.\\n\\n     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than\\none-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic\\nmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with\\nhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh\\nbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The\\nscientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds\\nand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.\\n\\n     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA\\'s Upper\\nAtmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements\\nProgram.                        \\n\\n                              #####\\n     ___    _____     ___\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\n    | | | |  __ \\\\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | Being cynical never helps \\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | to correct the situation \\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | and causes more aggravation\\n                                                  | instead.\\n',\n",

Well, I now have the\\nopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have\\nsome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.\\n\\nThe main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to\\nturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle\\ncomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple\\npolygons). For example, in the letter \"O\" there are two outlines:\\n\\n\\t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)\\n\\t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.\\n\\nOne common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply \\nconnect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the\\ntwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \"polygon with\\nholes\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior\\npolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.\\n\\nI do not want to use this simplistic system since:\\n\\n\\t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple\\n\\t\\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for\\n\\t\\tsome fancy fonts).\\n\\t2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.\\n\\nFrom my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid\\ndecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as\\nis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal\\npolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.\\n\\nMy question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into\\npolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution\\nsince it creates excess number of polygons.\\n\\nAnother question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create\\nbevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on these\\nsubjects but I can\\'t tell which method is the best to implement.\\n\\nThanks for any pointers.\\n\\n--> Rob Lansdale\\n\\n-- \\nRobert Lansdale - (416) 978-6619       Dynamic Graphics Project\\t\\nInternet: lansd@dgp.toronto.edu        Computer Systems Research Institute\\nUUCP:   ..!uunet!dgp.toronto.edu!lansd University of Toronto\\nBitnet:\\t  lansd@dgp.utoronto           Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A4, CANADA\\n',\n",

Koresh wasn\\'t\\neven a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that.\\n\\nJesus warned of such imposters in the end-times.  David\\nKoresh wasn\\'t anything new to Jesus.  Jesus told us to be\\naware of imposters 2000 years ago.  \\n\\nSo the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to\\nbe Jesus.  Ask the obvious.  Where were you born?  Was your\\nmother\\'s name Mary?  If the Branch Davidians asked that\\nsimple question, they would have labeled Koresh a liar\\nright from the start.  The wouldn\\'t have followed Koresh.\\nThey wouldn\\'t have died.  But look what happened.  Their\\nignorance cost them their lives.  Their choice to be ignorant\\ncost them a lot.\\n\\nKent, since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism, do you\\nnot remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus?  \\nDid not Satan quote the Bible out of context?  Do you\\nremember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to tempt\\nEve?  Did he not misquote God?  What Satan used on Eve and succeeded, \\nwas the same ploy he tried on Jesus.  But in Jesus\\'s case,\\nJesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible _in_ context.  It\\ndidn\\'t work with Jesus.  \\n\\nDoes what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satan\\ntried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what\\nKoresh did to his followers?

Good and\\nevil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.\\n\\nThe Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of\\nbeing. The warring opposites within us are a product of man\\'s\\nrebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of\\nthe Scriptures.\\n\\nMan was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words\\nof St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was\\nthat God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the\\nEastern Orthodox Church, this is called \"theosis,\" or \"deification.\"\\n\\nOne can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul,\\nand body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture\\nof the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs\\nwas a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the\\nCreator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God,\\ntheir natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly\\nirreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in\\ntheir lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This\\nis symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.\\n\\nThe beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it\\nwere to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil,\\nits paradisiac state would also be destroyed.\\n\\nWas it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of\\ninnocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining\\nof self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His\\nmasterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?\\n\\nGod must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral\\nvalue, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There\\nis no other way to achieve union with God.\\n\\nJesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities.\\nHe was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites,\\nand making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God,\\nnot in His essence, but in His energies.\\n\\nThe opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it\\nwith the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the\\nanswer to his dilemma in vs 25.\\n\\n                                 Mark\\n\\n',\n",

The moon\\'s lattice in the ether is like \\nsticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half \\nturn. The sun\\'s lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has \\ngot the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to \\nthe moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a \"j\" hook at \\nthe end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the \\nwhole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there. \\n\\n  With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon \\ncan be about as big as \"earth\\'s\" shadow upon it, and at other times \\ntotally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, \\nwould you guess that they are about the same size, just because they \\nlook about the same size?\\n\\n   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S\\n E       /     \\\\            \\n    M    |      |      OR                M    \\n         \\\\ _ _ /                         \\n       S                           \\n       \\n  The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate\\nof ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating \"turntable view\" \\nof the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I\\'ve seen a \\nhalf moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the \\nday. Try and draw that \"earth shadow.\") Its only the moon\\'s image \\nwhich appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is \\nthe part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away \\nfrom the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.\\n\\n  \"Light-Years\" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is \\ncloser to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase \\nof reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. \\n(defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be \\nessentially happening now. The \"piece\" of light may have experienced \\nmany years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.\\n\\n  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to \\nde-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design \\na propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like \\ntrying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)\\n\\n  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I\\'d \\nlook in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just \\nmight carry decipherable data. I\\'d start looking on some part of the \\nspectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ \\nbillion humans?) I\\'d totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG \\nbackwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card \\nfor Pentium!)\\n\\n  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound \\nmedia, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I \\nwould try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which \\nI\\'d start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. \\n[Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a \\ntwo foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I \\ncould get with my machine\\'s receiver next to it.  \\n\\n  If you don\\'t think you\\'ll live to see it, consider this: QUIT \\nPUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of \\nlife\\'s data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our \\nthoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By \\neating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant \\ninstructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or \\nbiblical guys did live hundreds of years. I\\'m curios to see what \\nthey did and ate. Don\\'t worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we \\ndon\\'t need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and \\nthat is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where \\ndid the household concept \\'immortal\\' come from? Wheat is a weed, it \\nis programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then \\ndie)\\n\\n  Warning about writing to the past:\\nI had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel \\nfuture, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. \\nThere were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an \\nOscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us, \\nand then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the \\nothers into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by \\n\"advising\" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into \\nreproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that \\nthe little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to \\nprovide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it \\nin his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his \\ncontrol. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying \\nthat there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve \\nsouls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was \\nfinite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in \\nour reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it \\nseemed odd, but we couldn\\'t remember how else it should be. Then \\nsome of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no \\nmore, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped \\nthrough his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that \\nhe had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, \\nexisting only on the wind. \\n\\n  MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls \\nwhose will\\'s are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat \\nothers as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a \\nlonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for \\nplaymates. (its not eternal, there\\'s more than one way back) \\n\\n Accepting rides to the past:\\nOnce here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a \\nPrince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go \\nahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. \\nI Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes \\nyour work, but thinks you\\'re getting wise, he can direct you to cross \\npaths with your old self, and you\\'ll vanish as you rewrite your own \\ncourse of history, none the wiser.\\n\\n  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped \\nback in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still \\nmake changes while he\\'s here, its just that that is work, and with \\nevery \\'adjustment\\', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which \\nloosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. \\nBut he can\\'t see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had \\nto apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand \\nto retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers. \\n\\n  How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, \\nour money, and they\\'re spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: \\nWashington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to \\ncongress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks \\nare making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big \\ncorporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the \\nbanks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but \\nmostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 \\nhours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time \\nto buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If \\nwe are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if \\nthe point is just to keep the people busy making widgets? \\n\\n  In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, \"its chaos!\" They \\nsaid, \"no, its order.\" He defined chaos as that which is he was not \\nable to control.\\n\\n  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy \\nwould hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no \\nlanguage. (telepathic; and \\'vanishing\\' the closest knowledge of death)\\n(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and \\npointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably \\nnaive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should \\nbe able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. \\nThey can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers \\nmight have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a \\ndifferent frequency than us as they aren\\'t eating seeds.\\n\\n  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a \\nhuge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat \\nonly fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and \\nneed a lot less sleep.\\n\\n  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The \\ntroops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill \\neach other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)\\n\\n  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot \\ntall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they \\nsuck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that \\nthey aren\\'t dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life. \\n\\n  Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women \\nand children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut \\nfrom the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think \\nthat there may be some very interesting results to this, such as \\nmother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples \\nof this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.\\n\\n  That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar.

(in which he can make it so) He\\'ll \\nplay a poker face up until he thinks he\\'s cornered, and then he\\'ll \\nwhine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you\\'re willing to \\nlive on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was \\nright, and he didn\\'t over play his hand, and he won\\'t need to go \\nback and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over \\nyour destiny, just don\\'t live along a path that leads to a reality \\nin which you don\\'t want to be a part of. \\n\\n  I don\\'t claim to be the first to think these things, its just \\nthat the others could have been \\'pruned\\' from our path.

One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his\\nmany colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based \\n(I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with \\nhis principles.

If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or\\nshe will end up in all sorts of shit.   \\n\\nTony\\'s argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe\\nthe events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone, \\nwho thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the\\nbook is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say \"a is\\nequal to b because a is equal to b\".\\n\\n  \\n\\n>\\tI don\\'t think most people understand what a Christian is.  \\n\\nThat would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed \\nin religious wars, and why there are hundreds of different versions all\\nclaiming to be correct.  \\n\\nIt \\n>is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.

In other\\n>words technically speaking Christians should use Saturday and not Sunday\\n>as their holy day, if they want to conform to the teachings of Jesus.\\n\\nI think the passage you\\'re looking for is the following.\\n\\nMatthew 5:17    \"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the \\nprophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. \\nMatthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, \\nnot an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. \\nMatthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments \\nand teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he \\nwho does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of \\nheaven. \\nMatthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of \\nthe scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. \\n\\nThere are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the\\nLaw was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but\\nnot on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human\\nbeings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The\\nissue that the Church had to face after Jesus\\' death was what to do\\nabout Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to\\nimpose the Law on them didn\\'t say that the Law was abolished.  It\\nsimply acknowledged that fact that it didn\\'t apply to Gentiles.  This\\nis a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.\\n(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded\\nin Acts 15.)\\n\\nHowever there\\'s more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the\\nrole of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul\\'s apparent\\nrejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus\\' commendation of\\nthe Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a\\npurpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this\\nissue isn\\'t one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his\\ndiscussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and\\nassures us that that\\'s not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees\\nthe Law as primarily being present to convict people of their\\nsinfulness.  But ultimately it\\'s an impossible standard, and one that\\nhas been superceded by Christ.  Paul\\'s comments are not the world\\'s\\nclearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the\\ninteresting thing to notice is that even this radical position does\\nnot entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an\\nuncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.\\nFor its purpose of convicting of sin, it\\'s important that it not be\\nrelaxed.  However for Christians, it\\'s not the end -- ultimately we\\nlive in faith, not Law.\\n\\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\\nbut in fact that\\'s not Jesus\\' approach.  Jesus\\' interpretations\\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\\nPaul\\'s conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\\n\\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\\nresponding to specific situations, he\\'s looking at the aspect of the\\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\\nto give Paul so much trouble.\\n\\nIt\\'s unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but\\nwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the\\nway terms like \"family values\" take on special meaning from the\\ncurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to\\nfigure out why \"family values\" should be used as a code word for\\nopposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I\\nthink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was\\ninvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values\\nthat go along with the term \"Law\", any more than people who concerned\\nabout the \"family values\" movement are really opposed to family\\nvalues.\\n',\n",

Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  \\nI BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even \\nafter reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.\\n\\nBut first let me say the following.\\nWe might have a language problem here - in regards to \"faith\" and\\n\"existence\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.\\nTo exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE\\nbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not\\nexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it\\'s rather pointless\\nto debate the so called \"existence\" of God - and that is not what\\nI\\'m doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of\\nbeing. When you say that \"god does not exist\", I also accept this\\nstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,\\nin what follows I will use the phrase \"the existence of God\" in it\\'s\\n\\'usual sense\\' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.\\nI would like a clarification upon what you mean by \"the existence of\\nGod\".\\n \\nWe also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what\\nWebster says:\\n\\nfaith \\n1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY\\nb  (1): fidelity to one\\'s promises\\n   (2): sincerity of intentions\\n2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God\\n   (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion\\nb  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof\\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n   (2): complete trust\\n3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system \\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nof religious beliefs\\nsyn see BELIEF\\n\\n\\n\\nOne can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say\\nthat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion\\n\"based upon observation\", I will have to ask \"what observtions are\\nyou refering to?\" There are NO observations - pro or con - that\\nare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations\\ncan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even\\nbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes \\npartents \"believe in God\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion\\nabout the \"existence\" or \"non-existence\" of God requires a leap - and\\nyou have made this leap when you actively say \"I believe that God  \\ndoes/does not exist\". Personally, I think that both statements are\\nmisguided. Arguing over the \"existence\" of God is precisely the wrong way\\nto find Him (and yes, I use \"Him\" because a personal God is the only \\nviable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use \"She\" go ahead. Of course \\nGod is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to \\nanthropomorphise.

Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research\\nspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not\\nas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am\\nnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns\\nout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \"Greek Lexicon\" renders\\neach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical\\norder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is\\nfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes\\nthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\\nindeed \"chorion.\" \\n\\nNow I\\'ve checked several Greek-English lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\\n\\n\\tA space, place, region, district, field, area, \"country place,\" \\n\\tland, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings.\\n\\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about \"grave.\" As some of these \\nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \\nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \\nthink it more likely that Mr Archer\\'s investigations into \"contradictions\" to \\nbe once again, as your friend said it, \"lacking in substance,\" and thus Archer \\nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \\nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\\nto support Mr Archer\\'s contentions). \\n\\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson\\'s) is the definition of\\n\"agros,\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\\n\"agros\" is defined as \"a field in the country.\" Chorion is specifically noted\\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\\nBullinger\\'s exegisis was, which stated that the word for \"field\" in Matthew\\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for \"field\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\\nadmit how stupid Bullinger\\'s exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\\nwhich drives the point home). \\n\\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \\nparticular issue closed.

When work for a large program like\\n   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the\\n   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts\\n   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the\\n   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to\\n   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about\\n   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10\\n   billion won\\'t be spent on anything having anything\\n   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion\\n   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn\\'t), but the work done\\n   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting\\n   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the\\n   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the\\n   term \\'center tax\\'. They look at the Station they are\\n   getting and the price they are paying and note that\\n   it doesn\\'t add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware\\n   that a third of the money is going for something else.\"\\n\\nMy dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple\\nof weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I\\ntalked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station\\nat Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn\\'t post a\\nresponse immediately, I do have a real job I\\'m supposed\\nto be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz\\ndata & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low\\non the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend\\nin Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers \\nAssociation conference, extolling the virtues of SSF\\nto 15,000 science teachers.]\\n\\nFirst off, yes, the concept of \\'center tax\\', or \\'wrap\\' does\\nexist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total \\'tax\\'\\nfor the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.\\nThis was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4\\ncenter \\'taxes\\'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at\\n$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is\\n04/2.2 = 1.8%\\n\\nOver the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30\\nbillion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to\\n$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I\\nwill concede it\\'s still an appreciable amount of pocket\\nchange.\\n\\nI should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could\\nbe close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds\\nthat are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some\\nstates, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat\\nthe food at the restaurant, but you don\\'t if you get it\\ntake-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds\\nwe receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*\\nsubject to the center tax (I don\\'t have the numbers in\\nfront of me, but I\\'d guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds\\ngo to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax\\nrate of 1/3, but it\\'s only applied to funds spent at the\\ncenter, and not to the prime contracts.\\n\\nThis leads to the obvious question \"What is the government\\ndoing with SSF funds that don\\'t go to the prime contractors?\\n(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A\\nbig portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens\\nto the balance of the funds, which aren\\'t eaten\\nup by the center tax?)\"\\n\\nAt WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting\\ndevelopment funds (as they are supporting the development\\nwork done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to\\nsetup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical\\npower system architecture. Our testbed has a real life\\nsolar array field (left over from solar cell research\\nresearch a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries\\n(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC\\nswitchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated\\nloads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent\\nchange evaluation involving concerns about the stability\\nof the power system.\\n\\nWe have also used the supporting development money to\\npurchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life\\ntesting at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in\\nIndiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on\\ntest recently hit the four year life test milestone.\\n38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the\\non-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).\\n\\nAs a final example, my \\'home\\' division at Lewis used\\nthe supporting development funds to purchase personal\\ncomputers and work stations, for performing system\\nanalyses (like modeling of the performance of the\\nelectrical power system, availability calculations\\nusing a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a \\ndatabase with information on weight of the power\\nsystem elements).\\n\\nFinally, the money raised by the \\'tax\\' does not all\\ngo into a \\'slush fund.\\' At Lewis, the director\\ndoes control a small discretionary fund. Each year,\\nany individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to\\nthe director to get money from this fund to look\\nat pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.\\n\\nMost of the tax, however, goes to fund the \\'general\\'\\nservices at the Center, like the library, the \\ncentral computer services division, the Contractor \\nwho removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather\\ndifficult to determine what percentage of the\\nSSF budget doesn\\'t go for SSF activities. To get\\nan accurate figure, you would have to take\\nthe annual expenditure for the library (for example),\\nand then divide by the amount of the library funds\\nused to support SSF (which would be hard to\\ncompute by itself - how would you figure out\\nwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for\\n1 year is \\'billable\\' to SSF, would you base it on\\nthe person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week\\nversus the rest of the center personnel). You would\\nthen have to compare this estimate of the SSF\\nportion of the library expense with the portion of\\nthe tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,\\nmaybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but\\nwe underpay for snow removal? Talk about\\na burecratic nightmare!\\n\\nMy last point is that I can\\'t believe your claim that\\nCongress has never heard of the term \\'center tax.\\'\\nUnfortunately, all of the NASA testimony before\\nCongress isn\\'t on a computer, so I can\\'t do a simple\\nword search someplace to prove you wrong.

I challenge all my Muslim brothers to produce a single \\nsuch evidence from the history of Islam!\\n\\nHence, if the Prophet Muhammad could never do that to anyone, how\\ncould the Muslims, Mullahs or even Governments of today do\\nit to anyone.

The Canon CLC 500 is a \\npublication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts \\nare less than acceptable.

Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format\\nand translating the image into postscript.\\n\\nWe suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality \\npictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the \\nSCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a \\nwarranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without \\nsome assurance that the product will work.\\n\\n\\nHere my questions:\\n\\nIf anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or \\nparallel port?

The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by\\n3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it\\nwasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he\\nincreased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps. \\n\\n   Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't know\\nwhat model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime\\ncould play back at the same speed even on an LCII.\\n\\n   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having\\na little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk!  This was\\nfrom memory!\\n\\n   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some\\nhardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the \\nanimation (like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator?)?\\n\\n   Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.\\n\\n   But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, I can\\nclaim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256,000+ colors in \\nmy computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with Scala MM210.\\n\\n   But I agree, if we consider MPEG stuff, I think a multimedia consumer\\nlow-priced box has a lot of market...

For\\ninstance, \\'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another\\nsimply to take pleasure in his suffering\\' might be thought of as a\\nplausible example.

The problem for the objectivist is to\\ndetermine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be\\nestablished.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what\\nis but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then\\nthey cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor\\ncan they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding\\ncontent;  \\'One ought always to do the right thing\\' is plainly true in\\nvirtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to\\naction (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may\\ntalk of \\'self-evident truths\\', but can he deny the subjectivist\\'s claim\\nthat self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left\\nof the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may\\nwell feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements\\nwith which he would wish to associate himself.

Everyone,\\n\\nBecause no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess\\nmy question was not so clear. Now I\\'d like to describe it in detail:\\n\\nThe offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which\\nrolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse\\nand its offset is same everywhere.\\n\\nThis problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.\\nThe tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the\\npositions of the ball\\'s center. Is the offset of an ellipse still\\nan ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial\\nStandard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was\\nimplemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold\\ninternationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!\\nHow many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most\\nimportantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?\\n\\nI was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year\\nto specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this\\nproblem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)\\nis not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire\\nor half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from\\na quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not\\nanalytical. I am now wondering if I didn\\'t touch the base and make things\\ncomplicated. Please give me a hint.\\n\\nI know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.\\nHowever, so many people involved in the problem \"sphere from 4 poits\".\\nWhy not an ellipse? And why not its offset?\\n\\nPlease post here and let the others share our interests \\n(I got several emails from our netters, they said they need the\\nsummary of the answers).\\n\\nYeh\\nUSC\\n',\n",

In fact, for the Bible to be of\\nany use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a\\nworkable moral system created for everyday use.\\n\\nThe Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing\\nevery word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of\\nIsrael were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial\\nLaws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance\\nof moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.\\n\\nIt seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo-\\nChristian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from\\nthe diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well\\nbe an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to\\nfollow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was\\nwritten down by man.\\n\\nThis leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the\\ndivine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many\\ndifferent ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the\\nfifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do\\nthat to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an\\nagnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit\\nsociety (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take\\nthe basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create\\nand justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables\\nthe people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers\\nhave done).\\n\\nWhatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I\\nthink the important aspect is the result.\\n\\nDavid.\\n\\n---\\nOn religion:\\n\\n\"Oh, where is the sea?\", the fishes cried,\\nAs they swam its clearness through.\\n\\n',\n",

Then, I point out that I am\\nnot clear what you did mean, rather than risking your childish ire, wrongly\\ninterpreting you a second time, and I\\'m stupid for it.  I just can\\'t win,\\ncan I, Fred?  You\\'ve got a great point here somewhere, it\\'s just that\\nbetween stupid people that you must insult, and your jealous guarding of\\nyour valuable opinions, you never actually get around to making it.\\n\\n>Please quote the \\'it\\' I took issue with.

Instead you have provided a good reason\\nto ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations\\nthat you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more\\nmeaning than they ever should have had.\\n\\nMy reading of what Nick actually said is that \"people aren\\'t required in\\nall parts of all space processes\", so your taking issue with his opinions\\nregarding people in the space program, I read as \"People are required in\\nall parts of all space processes.\"  So, help me out, here, Fred, since I\\'m\\nso patently stupid.  Did you read Nick wrong?  Or are you going to eat\\nyour terminal now?  If the latter, I sure hope it\\'s one of those Cheeto and\\nstring models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)\\n\\nThe point is, _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.  I\\'d\\nonly be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But, alas, that\\'s your\\njob, Fred.\\n\\nAnd, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points,\\nsimultaneously, with an allegory/insult.  Sadly, one point addressed a \\'plan\\'\\nthat only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors that\\nyou do as much as anyone.\\n\\n>More deliberate lack of understanding, Tommy?\\n\\nNo, no, I finally got it.  You don\\'t like the plan that Nick\\'s posts made\\nyou imagine.  And you don\\'t like Nick\\'s obnoxious behavior, even though\\nit\\'s no worse than your own.  Thanks for taking the time with someone as\\ndense as myself.\\n\\n>>>>If you have a problem with Nick\\'s delivery, address that.  The way you\\n>>>>bait, you\\'re perpetuating the lack of discourse that you complain of.\\n\\n>>>No, Tommy, the \\'bait\\' is that which elicits the response.  *NICK*\\n>>>\\'baits\\'; I just flame him for being an obnoxious fool.\\n\\n>>I don\\'t really care who started it.

If you do, consider that you saw\\nme come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years.\\nIf you had seen me on the net first, you\\'d remember when Nick and I went\\ndown exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It\\'s\\njust amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that\\'s\\nno worse than your own.\\n\\nLet\\'s see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical,\\nwhile your flames against people you decide are flamers isn\\'t, and my\\ncomplaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling\\nisn\\'t.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I might\\nsee it better, Fred.\\n\\n\"Net.ghod wannabe\"?  Naturally, Fred, you\\'ve correctly interpreted my\\nmotivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (as\\nyour insulting of people that try, proves).  I didn\\'t really care about\\npeople that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was to\\nimpress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on private\\nmail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such a\\njerk that you\\'d bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands.\\nAlas, I had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables and\\nbringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuable\\npurpose of embarassing me.  Whether I should feel stupid because I tried\\nto make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase I tried to\\ncommunicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isn\\'t clear.\\n\\nWell, Fred, you exposed me.  Now I\\'ll never be able to get a(nother) job\\nwith NASA, since they all know that I\\'m stupider than Fred McCall.  Well,\\nI just hope you\\'re happy.  Please leave me alone, now.

There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master \\n          (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES, \\n          a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and \\n          after the life of Jesus. \\n    \\n               The followers of some of these Masters founded the \\n          world\\'s major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of \\n          their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added \\n          THREATS of \"ETERNAL DAMNATION\" in Hell, and DELETED the \\n          teaching of REincarnation. \\n       \\n               Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular \\n          Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is \\n          NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively \\n          few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY \\n          alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE \\n          UNIVERSES.)                             \\n\\n               Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and \\n          pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from \\n          their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed \\n          themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly \\n          MANUFACTURED by the Romans. \\n      \\n               And emotional \"feelings\" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING \\n          indicator for religious validity. \\n    \\n               These things are similarly true for followers of most \\n          other major world religions, including Islam. \\n     \\n               Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune \\n          His Initiates into the \"AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\" or \"SOUND \\n          CURRENT\", (referred to as \"THE WORD\" in John 1:1-5, and as \\n          \"The River of Life\" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally \\n          guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they \\n          are still connected to their living physical bodies by a \\n          \"silver cord\". \\n    \\n               True Salvation, which completes a Soul\\'s cycles of \\n          REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved \\n          only by reaching at least the \"SOUL PLANE\", which is five \\n          levels or universes above the physical universe, and this \\n          canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine \\n          Master. \\n    \\n               One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri \\n          Harold Klemp, the Living \"Eck\" Master or \"Mahanta\" for the \\n          \"Eckankar\" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis, \\n          (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427). \\n    \\n               Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now \\n          living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the \"Sant \\n          Mat\" organization. \\n      \\n               One of the classic books on this subject is \"THE PATH OF \\n          THE MASTERS\" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA  \\n          90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian \\n          and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India \\n          studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of \\n          that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji. \\n    \\n               Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored \\n          by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in \\n          most public and university libraries and some book stores, or \\n          obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book \"ECKANKAR--THE \\n          KEY TO SECRET WORLDS\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER \\n          classic. \\n    \\n               Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with \\n          the \"Anti-Christ\", which is or was to be a temporary world \\n          dictator during the so-called \"last days\".  But the Masters \\n          don\\'t ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as \\n          Jesus was. \\n    \\n               People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or \\n          other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will \\n          CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the \\n          Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they \\n          finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine \\n          Master. \\n    \\n          \\n    \\n          RE-INCARNATION\\n          \\n               The book \"HERE AND HEREAFTER\", by Ruth Montgomery, \\n          describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation \\n          as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past \\n          lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes \\n          makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist], \\n          SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of \\n          whom can identify their most recent previous relatives, \\n          homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-\\n          ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-\\n          ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-\\n          ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS \\n          FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the \\n          Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How \\n          can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED \\n          BEFORE?!).

For example, \\n          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually \\n          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.  \\n          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to \\n          another person being met for the first time in THIS life, \\n          because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS \\n          INCARNATION. \\n\\n               The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF \\n          KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would \\n          behave much better toward each other if they knew that their \\n          actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the \\n          future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION! \\n\\n\\n\\n          \"2nd COMINGS\"\\n\\n               If a Divine Master physically dies (\"translates\") \\n          before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that \\n          Initiate physically dies (\"translates\"), the Master will meet \\n          him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul \\n          Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd \\n          Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that \\n          happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still \\n          waiting for Jesus\\' \"2nd Coming\" are WAITING IN VAIN. \\n    \\n          \\n          \\n          PLANES OF EXISTENCE\\n\\n               The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN \\n          major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the \\n          Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric \\n          Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane), \\n          the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The \\n          Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from \\n          the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the \\n          Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes. \\n    \\n               It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological \\n          influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See \\n          the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without \\n          an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between \\n          the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane. \\n    \\n               The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a \\n          sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called \"Hades\", and the \\n          Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there \\n          LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some \\n          kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a \\n          THREATENING manner.  The Christian \"Heaven\" is located \\n          elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there \\n          for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth. \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH\\n\\n               The Christian religion demands of its followers an \\n          extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more \\n          than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING). \\n       \\n               If a person is not HEARING some form of the \"SOUND \\n          CURRENT\" (\"THE WORD\", \"THE BANI\", \"THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\"), \\n          then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL \\n          CONTINUE. \\n    \\n               The \"SOUND CURRENT\" manifests differently for different \\n          Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on \\n          the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a \\n          flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar, \\n          Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as \\n          a Member.

Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\\nis possible that the histories I\\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\\nit - would it be in Hitler\\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \\n\\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \\nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \\nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \\nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \\nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \\n1920\\'s.\\n\\n>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\\n>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\\n>tainted evidence. \\n\\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \\nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\\'ve read), I\\'d like to know \\nwhat tainted \"evidence\" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \\nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \\naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \\n1920\\'s and 30\\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \\ntime and plant \"tainted\" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \\nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \\nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \\nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \\nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \\nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \\nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \\nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\\n\\n>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\\n>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, \"Storm Troopers\" -- left the world a better\\n>place when they departed, \\n\\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \\n\\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \\nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \\nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\\'t you write them \\nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\\'t tell from \\ntheir footnotes? I\\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\\'m not going to waste my time\\ntrying to debunk someone\\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.\\n\\n>but concrete particulars are still no more than\\n>more or less shrewd guesses.  \\n>-- Diccon Frankborn\\n\\nGiven that you already consider all evidence \"tainted\", what on earth would\\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\\nconsidered \"shrewd guesses\"?\\n\\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \\nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \\nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place \\nto start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.\\n\\nI\\'ll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already.

Mitchell\\n                          March 23, 1993\\n \\nINTRODUCTION:\\n \\nIn order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a\\nreal miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test\\ntele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals\\nlocated world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment\\npurposes.\\nNot only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and\\ntele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of\\ninformation\\non methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of\\na\\nlunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating\\neducational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and\\nachievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in\\nTwenty-First century remote learning methods.\\n \\nBecause of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests\\nand\\nskills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,\\ninterfacing\\nand electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving\\nplayground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and\\nprofessionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at\\na participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at\\nthe\\nLTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real\\nfacility\\nexists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the\\nconstruction\\nof the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested\\nby the users themselves.\\n \\nThis has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:\\n - tele-operations and virtual reality research\\n - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation\\n - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers\\n - art and theater\\n - bbs and online network users\\n - software and game developers\\n - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains\\n - children\\n - the child in all of us\\n \\nLTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:\\n \\nA room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used\\nfor murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.\\nThe \"floor\" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions\\nis hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and\\ncreation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and\\nmachine-lets.\\n \\n The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:\\n 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;\\n 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and\\n 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.\\n \\n Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on\\n it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture\\n content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent\\n to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.\\n \\nThe first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains\\nwith TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control\\nelectronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will\\nreceive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their\\ndata link to LTM1.\\n \\nNext, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a\\nservo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the\\nSSTO\\nto be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar\\nlandscape and land.\\n \\nFinally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped\\nbulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators\\nworldwide\\nto receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and\\ntakeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on\\ncommercially\\navailable items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the\\ninterface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced\\nham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.\\n \\nBy taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding\\na tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be\\nprovided in under 80 man hours.\\n \\nPLAN OF ACTION:\\n \\nThe Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by\\nproviding a host computer network and Internet access to that network.\\nDiaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction\\nof the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be\\nmodified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide \"rail stock\"\\nfor the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical\\ncommunications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.\\nAn initial \"ground breaking\" with miniature shovels will be performed for\\na live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial\\nmodels will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for\\nhistorical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely\\nserious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional\\nbuilding, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and\\nthe photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution\\nworld-wide to major online networks and bbs\\'s. A press release will be\\nissued\\ncalling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale\\nmodels\\nfor the simulated lunar colony.\\n \\nA contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then\\nbe\\nannounced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to\\nfind instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of\\nthe lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that\\ntime\\nthe results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will\\nthen be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return\\nto\\ntheir campus.\\n \\nA monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via\\nconventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment\\naddition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.\\nHaving a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo\\nopportunity for the television community. Especially since the \"action\"\\nwill\\nbe controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be\\ninvited to issue \"challenges\" to engineering and human factors students at\\nuniversities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform\\nlunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be\\nsimulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.\\n \\nThe long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,\\nexperimentation\\nand remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a\\nlong\\nterm global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic\\nexample of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited\\nto space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can\\nlead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!\\n \\nCONCLUSION:\\n \\nEduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has\\never enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a\\nglobally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation\\npurposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create\\nworld-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require\\nreal\\n(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people\\'s minds in\\nspace.\\n \\n \\nMOONLIGHTERS:\\n \\n\"Illuminating the path of knowledge about space and lunar development.\"\\nThe following people are already engaged in various parts of this work:\\nDavid42, Rob47, Dash, Hyson, Jzer0, Vril, Wyatt, The Dark One, Tiggertoo,\\nThe Mad Hatter, Sir Robin, Jogden.\\n \\nCome join the discussion any Friday night from 10:30 to midnight PST in\\n \\nDiaspar Virtual Reality Network.

This\\nsummarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300\\nparticipants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in\\nSeville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by\\nthe European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for\\nthe Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).\\n\\nOLYMPUS has been particularly useful :\\n-      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of\\n       new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small\\n       antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested\\n       data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,\\n       distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few\\n       examples.\\n\\n-      in opening the door to new telecommunications services\\n       which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-\\n       frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over\\n       Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.\\n\\n-      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS\\n       received for the first time in Europe, over several months,\\n       high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and\\n       then distributed it to various centres in Europe.\\n\\nWhen OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the\\nworld\\'s largest telecommunications satellite; and no other\\nsatellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four\\ndifferent payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.\\n\\nOLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some\\nof the world\\'s largest businesses. Access to the satellite is\\ngiven in order to test new telecommunications techniques or\\nservices; over the past four years some 200 companies and\\norganisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over\\n100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning\\norganisation.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the new technologies and services tested by these\\nOLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then\\nmake use of operational satellites such as those of\\nEUTELSAT.\\n\\nOLYMPUS utilisation will continue through 1993 and 1994,\\nwhen the spacecraft will run out of fuel as it approaches the\\nend of its design life.\\n\\n       \\n',\n",

The summaries below attempt to represent the position on which\\n    much of the net community has settled. Please DON\\'T bring them up again\\n    unless there\\'s something truly new to be discussed. The net can\\'t set\\n    public policy, that\\'s what your representatives are for.\\n\\n\\n    WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS\\n\\n    Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints\\n    have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on\\n    microfilm.\\n\\n    The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it\\n    is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960\\'s vintage hardware (like\\n    guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB\\n    have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch\\n    from.\\n\\n    By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify\\n    the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean\\n    sheet design.\\n\\n\\n    WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN\\'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE\\n\\n    Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access\\n    for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an\\n    opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being\\n    \"scooped\" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently\\n    releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early\\n    in a mission.\\n\\n\\n    RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES\\n\\n    There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to\\n    block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium\\n    thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in\\n    worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental\\n    reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.\\n    Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2\\n    RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather\\n    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months\\n    with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar\\n    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which\\n    was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in\\n    the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are\\n    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10\\n    half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].\\n\\n    To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to\\n    pursue are:\\n\\n    A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel\\n    Salisbury in \"Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG\\n    Controversy,\" *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7.

Studies\\n    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in\\n    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The\\n    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted\\n    study, Charles Jackman.\\n\\n    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the\\n    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was\\n    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space\\n    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia\\n    (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space\\n    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and\\n    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects\\n    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.\\n\\n    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:\\n\\n       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year\\n\\t  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year\\n\\t  Shuttle sources:\\t  725,000 kilograms/year\\n\\n    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are\\n    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the\\n    total stratospheric chlorine sources.\\n\\n    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would\\n    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability\\n    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.\\n\\n    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed\\n    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally\\n    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and\\n    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch\\n    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be\\n    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about\\n    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons\\n    do at the present time.\\n\\n    Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space\\n    Shuttle\\'s Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR\\n    Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W.

Holding your\\n    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to\\n    watch out for when ascending, and you\\'ll have eardrum trouble if your\\n    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal\\n    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no\\n    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do\\n    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.\\n\\n    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \"the bends\", certainly some\\n    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)\\n    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from\\n    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,\\n    you\\'re dying. The limits are not really known.\\n\\n    References:\\n\\n    _The Effect on the Chimpanzee of Rapid Decompression to a Near Vacuum_,\\n    Alfred G.

Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School\\n    of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.\\n\\n\\n    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED\\n\\n    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is\\n    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.\\n    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank\\n    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the\\n    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin\\n    team\\'s medical/forensic report.\\n\\n    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the\\n    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks\\n    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team\\n    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.\\n\\n\\n    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT\\n\\n    You can\\'t use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit\\n    because it can\\'t get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry\\n    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.\\n\\n    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of\\n    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in\\n    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly\\n    specialized for travel between Earth\\'s surface and low orbit. Taking it\\n    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would\\n    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit\\n    spacecraft.\\n\\n    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]\\n\\n\\n    THE \"FACE ON MARS\"\\n\\n    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid\\n    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:\\n    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often\\n    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13\\n    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).\\n\\n    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is\\n    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an\\n    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the\\n    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a\\n    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere\\n    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don\\'t\\n    know the address) to study the Face.\\n\\n    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution\\n    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this\\n    question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is\\n    best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or\\n    sci.astro.\\n\\n    V. DiPeitro and G.

An atheist is one for whom all things can\\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\\ndetermnined.\\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\\nacquire intelligence, it\\'s just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\\nan event can have value. \\nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\\nhill.\\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\\nestablish your values.\\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n- that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\nThat you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\nor God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\\'ve been\\nconditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\\nI didn\\'t make these rules, it\\'s inherent in naturalistic atheism and\\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\\nthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded\\nyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\\netc. and cannot participate.

It uses freon jets for\\nsteering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie\\nduring our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much\\ncontinuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).

Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and\\ncommercial space.  This is how it went...\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,\\nI called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty\\nMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard\\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.\\nLater in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.\\n\\nWe got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,\\nwho scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not\\nbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \\nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.\\n\\nWell, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking\\nto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.\\nWe covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  \\nMost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another\\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that\\nwe brought up.\\n\\nBut, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate\\naligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.\\nSo, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\\nLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming \\nfeasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.\\nWe hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism\\npaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the\\natmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog\\nover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is \\nmore pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to \\nunderstanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education \\nwhereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that\\nthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other\\nfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday \\nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.\\n\\nWe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business\\nangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal\\ncommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided\\nin those sectors.\\n\\nJobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..\\nWe mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.\\n\\nWe left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order\\nto make this even easier to do.

Out of how many?  What are the different levels?  I've never\\n   heard of this rating system.  Anyone care to clue me in?\\n\\nThis is a rating system used by ARPA and other organisations to\\nmeasure the maturity of a `software process' i.e. the entire process\\nby which software gets designed, written, tested, delivered, supported\\netc.\\n\\nSee `Managing the Software Process', by Watts S. Humphrey, Addison\\nWesley 1989. An excellent software engineering text. The 5 levels of\\nsoftware process maturity are:\\n\\n1. Initial\\n2. Repeatable\\n3. Defined\\n4. Managed\\n5. Optimizing\\n\\nThe levels are approximately characterized as follows:\\n\\n1. no statistically software process control. Have no statistical\\n   basis for estimating how large software will be, how long it will\\n   take to produce, how expensive it will be, or how reliable it will\\n   be.  Most software production is at this level.\\n\\n2. stable process with statistical controls, rigorous project\\n   management; having done something once, can do it again. Projects\\n   are planned in detail, and there is software configuration\\n   management and quality assurance.\\n\\n3. The process is defined and understood, implementation is\\n   consistent. This includes things like software inspection, a\\n   rigorous software testing framework, more configuration management,\\n   and typically a `software engineering process group' within the\\n   project.\\n\\n4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered\\n   and analysed, and the process is controlled on the basis of this\\n   information. Software quality is measured and has goals.\\n\\n5. Defects are prevented, the process is automated, software contracts\\n   are effective and certified.\\n\\nNick Haines nickh@cmu.edu\\n\",\n",

If I forgot or botched your\\nfavorite acronym, please let me know!  Also, if there\\'s an acronym *not*\\non this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figure\\nit out, I\\'ll add it to the list.\\n\\nNote that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen*\\nacronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.  If I incorporated\\nevery acronym I ever saw, I\\'d soon run out of disk space!  :-)\\n\\nThe list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days.  All\\ncomments regarding it are welcome; I\\'m reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.\\n\\nNote that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you\\'re on your\\nown for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number of\\nacronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that\\nare essentially always explained as they\\'re introduced are omitted.\\nFurther, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of\\nthe list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they\\'re simply\\ndifferent ways of referring to the same thing.\\n\\nThanks to everybody who\\'s sent suggestions since the first version of\\nthe list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu),\\nwho is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in\\ncharacter than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de),\\nwho is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and\\nterms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately).\\n\\nSpecial thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA\\nReference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System and\\nAssociated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a truly\\nmammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.\\n\\nSpecial Bonus!

It\\nis not, however, an indicator of performance, as that will vary strongly\\nfrom machine to machine and vendor to vendor.  SGI is committed to high\\nperformance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so OpenGL\\nmeans that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms, there is no\\nguarantee that your performance would be comparable.\\n\\n|> \\n|> What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that\\n|> we *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the\\n|> Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.\\n\\nIf your sales representative truly mislead you, then you should have a\\nvalid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGI\\nsales management team. Feel free to contact the local branch manager...we\\nunderstand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers, so give it a\\nshot.\\n\\n|> \\n|> I\\'m also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at a\\n|> previous site on the understanding *that* architecture would be around\\n|> for a while, rather than being flushed.\\n\\nAs one of the previous posts stated, the Personal IRIS was introduced in\\n1988 and grew to include the 4D/20, 4D/25, 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rates\\nsped up over time. As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5\\nyears. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series (\\'85-\\'89), the PI\\n(\\'88-\\'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D\\'s - \\'86-\\'90), the Power\\nSeries parallel systems (\\'88-\\'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a\\nparticular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics\\narchitectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every\\n18 months to 2 years.\\n\\nThese are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become\\nalmost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new\\nplatform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths,\\nfaster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If we\\ndon\\'t, we become uncompetitive.\\n\\nFrom the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your\\ncurrent needs and makes economic sense today.

Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I\\'ll\\ntry to get better.\\n\\nRob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle\\napproach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far,\\nonly responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both\\ncases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse\\nfor myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.\\n\\nRob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K. \\nvasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is\\nan excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.  \\nI think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with\\nhis set of excuses.  \\n\\nI just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants\\nto know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses\\nwhich have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the\\nBible for himself and come to his own decisions without being\\nsidetracked with the temptation to mock God.\\n\\nFrom my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man\\nstanding out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I \\nsee a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away\\nfrom the oncoming truck.  He doesn\\'t see it.   Here\\'s is how I see\\nthe dialog:\\n\\n\\nMe:  \"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\" \\n\\nBK:  \"There is no truck.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"Turn around at look.\"\\n\\nBK:  \"No.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at\\n     the oncoming truck.\"\\n\\nBK:  \"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"Turn around or you will run over.\"\\n\\nBK:  \"No. I won\\'t because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing\\n      to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\"\\n      I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.\\n\\nBK:  \"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.\\n      Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\"\\n      And by the way, I really have an open mind.\"\\n\\n\\nSo is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?   \\n\\nI do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not\\nbillions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people\\nfall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have.\\nI can now see the truck behind Brian.\\n\\nMy hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the\\ntruck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out\\nof the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself\\nto the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if\\nhe so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that\\nto change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment,\\nBrian hasn\\'t gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he\\ndoes not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his\\nhead will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is\\nsatisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. \\n\\nThank you again Rob for your reproach.  I really do appreciate it.

The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\n the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\n to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]\\n\\n  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \\netymology. It may originally have meant \"member of the tribe,\" as in the\\nAvestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). This meaning\\nwould have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \"member of the priestly\\ntribe\" and perhaps to \"priest\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is\\nprobably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \"Magoi\" as one of\\nthe six tribes of the Medes.\\n  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a\\npriestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were\\nresponsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their\\nknowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median\\npriesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median\\nmonarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century\\nthrough the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the\\nGreat (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political\\nand civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced\\nconcerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\\n(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is\\ndemonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by\\nDarius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by\\nGreek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of\\nthe Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.\\n  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the\\nsacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the\\npossibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be\\nattested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.\\n  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi\\nare members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of\\nthe priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is\\nuntenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the\\nAvestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is\\nnot without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,\\nin conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\\npurity, or separation of the \"mixture\" of the two opposed principles of spirit\\nand matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \"chorus,\" from\\nthe root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) and\\nhas been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an\\necstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\\nthere may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms\\nmagavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\\nAvestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite\\na recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore\\nthe Avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is \\nperhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis \\n(Gershevitch, 1964).\\n  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\\nPahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\\nparticular derives from an older form, magupati (\"head of the Magi\"). During\\nthe Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of\\na hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of\\nhigh priests\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\\nhierarchy.\\n  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\\nkhwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\\nthe corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\\nThe corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\\nof putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\\ncommunity and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\\nParsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\\nrite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\\nin vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\\nwax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\\nof Central Asia.\\n  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\\noffer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\\nritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\\ncustodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\\nrelationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\\ncalled upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\\nknown for the practice of killing harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra)\\nsuch as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\\ntunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\\nfelt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\\nand mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\\nbreath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\\nthat is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\\nthat of the priesthood: white.\\n  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\\npossession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\\ngradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\\nprofessional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\\ninclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\\njealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\\nthey were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\\nfor teaching the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\" and thus\\nthe \"cult of the gods.\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\\nthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\\nmaster of himself.\\n  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\\ninfluence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\\nseveral dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\\nGaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\\nSmerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\\nthe Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\\nin Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\\nas a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\\n  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\\nrenowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\\nthe greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\\nwho arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\\nBethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\\nalso known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\\nthis was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\\nlike \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\\nChaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\\nhad a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\\n  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\\nis necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\\nwestern Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\\nhave been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\\nIranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\\ncontact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\\nvarying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\\n  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\\nvarying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\\nhistorians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\\ncustoms, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\\nbelief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\\nand eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\\neven speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\\nMagi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\\nZoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\\nplaced themselves under his venerable name.\\n  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\\neastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\\nelements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\\noften, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\\nZoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjuring\\ndaivas\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\\ntexts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\\npractices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\\nchapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\\nsupreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\\nGathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\\nall evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\\nland of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\\nhas been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\\nabsence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\\npriesthood, would be very strange.\\n  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\\ncorpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\\nfirst millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\\ndirectly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\\nus especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\\nthe ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\\nof the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\\nspirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\\nMainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\\nformation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\\nastrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\\nMesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\\nto the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\\nsee the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\\nwe give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\\n  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\\nimportant role in the transmission of Zarathushtra\\'s treachings, as well as in\\nthe definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\\nnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of\\nZoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began\\nto study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,\\nHermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises\\non the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have\\nsurvived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of\\nwisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\\nof such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an\\nabundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\\n  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\\nground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\\n_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\\nmost likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\\nsecond century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\nthe Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\nto Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\\n  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the\\nreligious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,\\n1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of\\nIran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to\\nestablish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an\\northodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures\\nin the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar\\nand Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.\\n\\nSAOSHYANT:\\n  The Avestan term saoshyant (\"future benefactor\"; MPers., soshans) designates\\nthe savior of the world, who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind.\\nThe concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of Zoro-\\nastrianism, together with that of dualism; it appears as early as in the Gathas.\\nZarathushtra (Zoroaster), as the prophet of the religion, is himself a Sao-\\nshyant, one who performs his works for the Frashokereti, the end of the present\\nstate of the world, when existence will be \"rehabilitated\" and \"made splendid.\"\\n[See Frashokereti]\\n  Later Zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatological\\nmyth and expanded the number of Saoshyants from one to three. All the saviors\\nare born from the seed of Zarathushtra, which is preserved through the ages in\\nLake Kansaoya (identified with present-day Lake Helmand, in Seistan, Iran),\\nprotected by 99,999 fravashis, or guardian spirits. The greatest of the awaited\\nSaoshyants, the victorious Astvatereta (\"he who embodies truth\"), the son of\\nthe Vispataurvairi (\"she who conquers all\"), is the third, who will make\\nexistence splendid; he appears in Yashts 19. Upon his arrival humankind will\\nno longer be subject to old age, death, or corruption, and will be granted\\nunlimited power. At that time the dead will be resurrected, and the living will\\nbe immortal and indestructable. Brandishing the weapon with which he kills the\\npowerful enemies of the world of truth (that is, the world of the spirit, and\\nof asha), Astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and\\nrender it imperishable. He and his comrades will engage in a great battle with\\nthe forces of evil, which will be destroyed.\\n  The name Astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation\\n(Kellens, 1974), as are those of his two brothers, Ukhshyatereta, \"he who makes\\ntruth grow,\" and Ukhshyatnemah, \"he who makes reverence grow\"; the names of the\\nthree virgins (Yashts 13) who are impregnated with the seed of Zarathushtra\\nwhen they bathe in Lake Kansaoya and give birth to the Saoshyants, are equally\\nspeculative. Each of these Saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of a\\nmillennium, initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence; Astvatereta will\\nappear in the third and final millennium to save mankind.\\n  The doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the Archaemenid\\nperiod (sixth to fourth century BCE). It was not, perhaps the principal element\\nin the formation of the messianic idea, but it was certainly a determining\\nfactor, one that enjoyed great success in the Hellenistic period beyond the\\nconfines of the Iranian world. A similar concept, that of the future Buddha,\\nMaitreya, was most likely indebted to it, and Christian messianism can trace\\nits roots to the same source.\\n',\n",

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology\\nPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the\\nRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance\\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\\nstation.\\n\\n        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each\\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\\noperations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research\\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\\n\\n        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\\nbudget for the President\\'s new technology investment.  As a result,\\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\\nreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station\\noption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA\\nbudget over the next 5 years.\\n\\n        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\\nthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon\\nadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also\\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\\nStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory\\ncommittee to consider.\\n\\n        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its\\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have\\ndecided, after consultation, to give \"full consideration\" to use of\\nRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\\n\\n        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR\\nand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.\\nThe U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\\nthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The\\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\\nthat goal.\\n\\n        Gibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is committed to the\\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\\nrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well\\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\"\\n\\n        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian\\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science\\nCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald\\nSagdeev.\\n\\n------- End of Blind-Carbon-Copy\\n',\n",

Christian people have caused\\n\"objective morality\" to look very \"relative.\"  After all, that was the\\npoint of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out\\nChristianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own\\nprinciples?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this\\napparent inconsistency from at least one Christian\\'s viewpoint:\\n\\nIf God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then\\nHe has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick\\nphysically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an \"objective\" morality for us.\\nThat is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or\\ndetrimental to) the creature He created. \\n\\n\\tGalatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in\\n\\tChrist Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared\\n\\tbeforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.\\n\\nHowever, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees\\nof the Bible,) God\\'s morality cannot be completely codified in a list\\nof rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a\\nperson\\'s life creates a new situation to which morality must be\\napplied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God\\'s\\n\"objective\" morality for us. \\n\\nThroughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of\\nrules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have\\nboth principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the\\nprinciples were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules.\\nVolumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the\\napplication of the principles.  We [mankind] weren\\'t comfortable with\\nthe \"subjectivity\" of principles. \\n\\n\\tFor reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference\\n\\tbetween the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in\\n\\tverses 21-22:  \"You have heard that the ancients were told,\\n\\t\\'You shall not commit murder\\'...and \\'Whoever commits murder shall\\n\\tbe liable to the court.\\'  But I say to you that everyone who is\\n\\tangry with his brother shall be liable to the court...\"\\n\\nThe \"objective morality\" of God gets blurred by our inept\\ninterpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors\\nwhen we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY\\nwhat God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to\\nseeking God\\'s will instead of trying to prove we already had it all\\nfigured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God\\'s\\n\"objective morality\" for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said he\\nwas/is (and that\\'s the fundamental question,) then HE IS \"objective\\nmorality.\" \\n\\nJohn Nunnally\\n',\n",

The\\nprogram was described by these men as \"ineffective . . . not one person was\\nhealed.\"  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent\\nfeelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were\\ndriven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed \"reparative therapy.\"\\n\\nThe previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June\\n30, 1992 called \"The Ex-Ex-Gay\" by Robert Pela.\\n\\nSome personal thoughts:\\n\\nIt is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major\\nportion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among\\nits ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all\\nthey required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to\\nsave their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even\\nlater, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and\\nsegragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings.\\nToday\\'s scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is\\nstill coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind\\ncontrol, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than\\nGod sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt\\nthier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is \"physically\" forced\\nto stay in this \"reparative therapy\" but sheer social pressure is enough for\\nmany to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.\\n\\nAs an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution\\nagainst gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by\\nthe contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live,\\nnot by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven\\';t\\na clue what is in their heart.\\n\\nFor those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them\\nplease contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians\\nAnd Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.

Hopefully, you won\\'t\\nget flamed, either.\\n\\nYou will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project is\\nbuilt on unsteady ground.\\n\\nFirst, I do not believe that there is any way to find an \"objective morality\". \\nMorality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a\\nperson or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps even\\noverwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.\\n\\n> Assumptions:\\n> \\n> (1) A Christian bedrock assumption that all that is True, comes\\n> Truly from God. \\n> \\n> (2) Regarding alt.sex.stories.

If, as you say,\\nyou are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by\\nusing the Christian Bible?  You\\'re defeating your own purpose by doing so.\\n \\n> In the long run, the advantage of making such a literary/moral\\n> analysis is that it will save band-width between Christians and\\n> non mutually flaming each other about the moral acceptability of\\n> the stuff on these (pornographic) groups.\\n\\nThird, call me a pessimist, but you won\\'t stop the flamage.  There will always\\nbe people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we\\nall are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the\\nreligion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring,\\noverbearing totalitarianists?\\n \\n> Basically, there should not be a dissonance between a \"Christian\"\\n> morality and a \"non-Christian\" one.  Either there is value in a\\n> particular work, or there is not whether one is a Christian or\\n> not.\\n\\nHm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, to\\ndiscuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  I\\nstart off by saying that I think it\\'s immoral to force people to have sex with\\nyou.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of\\nyour own gender.  (Just a note: I really don\\'t know your views on\\nhomosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the\\npurposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to\\nhave their faces uncovered.\\n\\nThe sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but\\nfeels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind. \\n                                                                         \\n> In support for the first assumption:\\n> \\n> The Christian scriptures say this:\\n\\n\\t(Evidence deleted)\\n\\nI\\'m not going to accept your evidence for this.  You ask us to accept \"The Word\\nof God\" that everything good comes from God.  This is only a valid argument for\\na person who shares your beliefs.\\n\\nStill, I must say that cataloging the major themes and motifs in erotica could\\nbe interesting for other reasons than yours, so good luck with this next part.\\n\\n>                                                                        \\n>              **************************************\\n> \\n> NOW THEN what are some of the major themes/motifs in the\\n> pornographic literature on places like alt.sex.stories?

An awful lot of the\\nstarvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic\\npolicies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical\\nWesterner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible\\nmalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can\\nbe fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They\\nhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans\\nwe encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre\\nidea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they\\'ve got.\\n\\nPerhaps it\\'s more accurate to say that there\\'s a Western ethic against\\nWestern infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children\\nare dying in the Third World, we couldn\\'t give a shit.  And that goes for the\\nsupposed \"Pro-Life\" movement, too.

Hell, if they\\'re only interested in fetuses, they could save more\\nof those by fighting for human rights in China.\\n\\nAnd besides, Suzanne\\'s answer implies that non-Western countries lack this\\nethic against infanticide.

D1).  I thought I\\'d post it to\\nstir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by\\nsaying that I largely agree that the \"Space Age\" in the romantic sense\\nof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station\\nmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, \"What\\'s New\" -\\nthe weekly physics update we get here on the net - it\\'s clear that the\\nromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of\\nmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with\\nits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things\\npeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I\\nthink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of\\nnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our \"mind\\nchildren\" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but\\nI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about\\nwhat we can do *now*.   \\n\\nAnyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...\\n\\n\\nSPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW\\n\\nMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)\\n\\nAt 35, America\\'s Space Age won\\'t have to suffer through the angst of a\\nmidlife crisis.\\n\\nThe reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no\\nlonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion\\n-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic\\nrewards.  \\n\\nSpace exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America\\'s science\\nand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a\\nmeaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our\\ntechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion\\npolicy.  \\n\\nTo be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies\\nfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes\\nwould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of\\nscientific and industrial innovation is now dead.\\n\\n.....\\n\\nBefore the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to\\nwrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively\\nsupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion\\nto build space station Freedom alone.\\n\\nEven as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,\\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken\\npublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much\\nof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope\\nto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively\\nimplemented did not seem to matter much.\\n\\nPolitical inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent\\nvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar\\nspace budgets.\\n\\nIndeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo\\nera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration\\nwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  \\n\\n......\\n\\nWhile the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel\\nGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\\nAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being\\npositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America\\'s\\ntechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been\\nslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions\\nits competitiveness agenda.\\n\\n......\\n\\n\"I wish this had happened 10 years ago instead of starting to happen\\nnow,\" says Bruce Murray, a Caltech professor who ran NASA\\'s Jet\\nPropulsion Lab in Pasadena.  \"We\\'ve put off a lot of things we shouldn\\'t\\nhave.... I would rather see a $10-billion NASA doing well than a\\n$40-billion one filled with white elephants.\"\\n',\n",

Hawking, whose theories attempt to\\nexplain the origin of distant galaxies, black holes and alternate\\ndimensions, wanted to re-visit JPL, he explained, \"because while\\nI\\'m most interested in those things in space that are farther\\naway, I know that here is where the first steps are taken.\"\\n     Hawking, who was accompanied by his family, two graduate\\nstudents and his aides, began the tour in von Karman Auditorium,\\nas David Evans, deputy assistant Lab director in the Office of\\nFlight Projects, and Dr. Arden Albee, Mars Observer\\'s project\\nscientist, briefed him on current and past flight projects.\\n     Voyager was pointed out to him, with special attention paid\\nto a gold plate with a series of engraved images. Should\\nextraterrestrial life stumble upon the spacecraft, Evans noted,\\nthey would find a variety of images that would explain something\\nof Earth. The professor asked if we were still communicating with\\nthe spacecraft, and Evans affirmed that we are.\\n     Using a model of Mars Observer, Albee spent several minutes\\ndescribing the project and the spacecraft\\'s features. In answer\\nto a question from Hawking, Chahine described a proposed\\ndrag-free satellite, but confirmed that at this point, \"it\\'s only\\na concept.\" Chahine, who had met Hawking at Caltech about five\\nyears before, described the professor as \"a living miracle of the\\npower of the brain.

Project Scientist Dr. Eric De Jong\\nshowed off the latest data -- a comet that had only recently been\\ndiscovered in orbit close to Jupiter. Hawking was curious about\\nits composition, and as he was shown how images are developed, he\\nasked several questions on their interpretation.\\n     Norman Haynes, ALD, Office of Telecommunications and Data\\nAcquisition, briefed the professor on the Space Flight Operations\\nFacility, and then Hawking spoke with Stone.\\n     The day ended with two technical discussions of particular\\ninterest to the professor. Technical Group Leader Dr. Frank\\nEstabrook and Senior Research Scientist Hugo Wahlquist described\\na three-spacecraft gravity wave experiment, currently under way.\\nThen planetary astronomer Dr. Richard Terrile explained the\\nphilosophy and plans for extra solar system planetary detection.\\n     The Hawking party, which had been visiting Southern\\nCalifornia for five weeks, was headquartered at Caltech, and\\nplanned to leave for England within a few weeks after the Lab\\ntour.

Basically it changes things\\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\\n   other users.\\n\\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\\n\\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\\n\\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\\n\\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\\n\\n    o User Interface Panels\\n\\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\\n\\tfaster frame rates)\\n\\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\\n\\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\\n\\n  Server(s):\\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\\n\\n    o Transparent Client Management\\n\\n    o Client Message Handling\\n\\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\\naccepting and\\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\\napplication writer\\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\\n\\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\\n\\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\\n        initialisers you want.\\n\\n    o Event Handler Registration:\\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\\n\\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\\n\\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\\n    from which to choose.\\n\\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\\n\\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\\n        any initialization you want to do.\\n\\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\\n\\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\\n\\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\\n    three world servers I've provided:\\n\\n        generic - 81 lines\\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\\n                           stairs! Will probably be improved with future\\n                           versions)\\n        dogfight - 72 lines\\n\\nLocation:\\n\\n   This software is located at the following site:\\n   ftp.u.washington.edu\\n\\n   Directory:\\n   pub/virtual-worlds\\n\\n   File:\\n   multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z\\n\\nFutures:\\n\\n   Client:\\n\\n    o Texture mapping.\\n\\n    o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading\\n\\n    o HMD support.\\n\\n    o Etc, etc....\\n\\n   Server:\\n\\n    o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).\\n\\n    o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction\\n\\n    o Etc, etc....\\n\\n   Both:\\n\\n    o Improved Comms!!!\\n\\nI hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse\\nsoftware,\\nunfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure\\nwhether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(\\n\\nI hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of\\nthe Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I\\nwould *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!\\n\\nFinally one major disclaimer:\\n\\nThis is totally amateur code.

O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free\\nfrom all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be\\nestablished in the self.\\n  \\n                                PURPORT\\n\\n All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three\\nmodes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which\\ncause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive\\nactivities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of\\nsense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna,\\nas a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to\\nthe transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the\\nbeginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme\\ntranscendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are\\nstruggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of\\nthe material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get\\nrid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense\\ngratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the\\nchance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the\\nUpanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a\\npart of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the\\nbeginning of transcendental life.\\n\\n As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in\\nthe material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities\\nsuch as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating\\nsuch dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This\\ntranscendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one\\nis fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.\\n\\nBhagavad-Gita As It is\\nBooks of A.C.

I\\'ve typed it in verbatim, for you\\nfolks to chew over. Many of the topics recently\\ndiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.\\n\\nGibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance\\n\\nDr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and\\nTechnology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of\\nthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space\\nStation on April 3, three budget options as guidance to\\nthe committee in their deliberations on the redesign of\\nthe space station.\\n\\nA low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7\\nbillion and a high option of $9 billion will be\\nconsidered by the committee. Each option would cover\\nthe total expenditures for space station from fiscal\\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for\\ndevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttle\\nintegration, facilities, research operations support,\\ntransition cost and also must include adequate program\\nreserves to insure program implementation within the\\navailable funds.\\n\\nOver the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within\\nthe NASA budget for the President\\'s new technology\\ninvestment. As a result, station options above $7\\nbillion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in\\nthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space\\nstation option of $9 billion would require $2 billion\\nin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.\\n\\nGibbons presented the information at an organizational\\nsession of the advisory committee. Generally, the\\nmembers-designate focused upon administrative topics\\nand used the session to get acquainted. They also\\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation\\non the process the Station Redesign Team is following\\nto develop options for the advisory committee to\\nconsider.\\n\\nGibbons also announced that the United States and its\\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and\\nCanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give\\n\"full consideration\" to use of Russian assets in the\\ncourse of the space station redesign process.\\n\\nTo that end, the Russians will be asked to participate\\nin the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting\\nbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of their\\nexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the\\npossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and\\nsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope to\\nbenefit from the expertise of the Russian participants\\nin assessing Russian systems and technology. The\\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop\\noptions for reducing station costs while preserving key\\nresearch and exploration capabilities. Careful\\nintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor in\\nachieving that goal.\\n\\nGibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is\\ncommitted to the redesigned space station and to making\\nevery effort to preserve the science, the technology\\nand the jobs that the space station program represents.\\nHowever, he also is committed to a space station that\\nis well managed and one that does not consume the\\nnational resources which should be used to invest in\\nthe future of this industry and this nation.\"\\n\\nNASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russian\\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-\\nWest Space Science Center at the University of Maryland\\nunder the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.\\n\\n',\n",

By biblical scholar I mean\\nan expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the\\nchips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be\\ndefined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are\\nnot trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).\\n\\nWhy an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly\\nout of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere \\nin his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which \\nit lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.\\n\\nUntil you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about\\nthe Josephus insert, your \"proof\" is meaningless and it should not be repeated\\nhere.  What\\'s more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would \"prove\"\\nnothing.  Scholars speak of the \"weight of evidence.\"  Far more independent\\nevidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your\\nbelief is based on faith.  That\\'s OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass\\nfaith off as fact.\\n\\nAs for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring\\ninconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn\\'t a perfect canon be perfect? \\nShouldn\\'t there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel \\nFictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for \\nHerb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share \\nan evolutionary ancestry).\\n\\nThe fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny\\nyour position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels \"prove\" your faith. \\nIndependent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already\\ndiscussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith. \\nMoreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted\\nto \"prove\" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than\\nsaying \"I am right because I say so.\"  \\n\\nYour logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian \\nGeneral Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where\\n\"fundamentalist\" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1)\\nJesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily\\nresurrected, 4) Jesus\\' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the\\nclincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe\\n\"inerrant\" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the\\nfirst four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant\\nbible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to \\ncontain the first four.  \\n\\nSmoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!\\n\\nIts faith, Bill.

If not, here are\\ntwo ways to get a copy without waiting for the next posting:\\n\\n    (1) If your machine is on the Internet, it can be obtained by anonymous\\nFTP from the SPACE archive at ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) in directory\\npub/SPACE/FAQ.\\n\\n    (2) Otherwise, send email to 'archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov'\\ncontaining the single line:\\n\\nhelp\\n\\n    The archive server will return directions on how to use it. To get an\\nindex of files in the FAQ directory, send email containing the lines:\\n\\nsend space FAQ/Index\\nsend space FAQ/faq1\\n\\n    Use these files as a guide to which other files to retrieve to answer\\nyour questions.\\n\\n    Shuttle launch dates are posted by Ken Hollis periodically in\\nsci.space.shuttle. A copy of his manifest is now available in the Ames\\narchive in pub/SPACE/FAQ/manifest and may be requested from the email\\narchive-server with 'send space FAQ/manifest'. Please get this document\\ninstead of posting requests for information on launches and landings.\\n\\n    Do not post followups to this article; respond to the author.\\n\",\n",

S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, \"Love is the unfamiliar Name\\nthat wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...\"\\n\\nThis is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise\\nin my note, as will become more evident below.\\n\\n>As a non-believer, I find Michael\\'s Christianity kinder and gentler.\\n\\nblechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though,\\ngiven my principle that one CANNOT force one\\'s own notion of \"sin\" on\\nanother, and my unshakeable \"disestablishmentarianism\", Russel Turpin\\nand others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my\\nlegislating my own understanding of Christian love.\\n\\n>If I take him at\\n>his word, he cannot condemn the Inquisitors, because they were\\n>also following these commandments as *they* understood them.  If\\n\\nYou misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of\\naccusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form\\nas anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human\\nbeings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \"God\"\\nin near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:\\n\\nThe \"possibility that always exists\" is that I (or, to revert to proper\\ntime sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could\\npersuade \"Christian B\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed\\nconstitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note\\nthat the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian\\nargumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]\\nprohibitions.\\n\\nWhat Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:\\n\\n\\tA.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved\\n\\t    in the Inquisition.\\n\\n\\tB.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however\\n\\t    painful this *seems*, \"discipline\" her children for their\\n\\t    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or\\n\\t    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example\\n\\t    \"deterring\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)\\n\\n\\tA.  I point out that this \"justification\" of a failure in love\\n\\t    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of\\n\\t    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.\\n\\n\\tB.  Burns me at the stake.\\n\\nMy rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is\\ngoing on here has a *lot* to do with \"cultural baggage.\"  In this case,\\nthe baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief\\nthat an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most\\nbelievable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial\\npractice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least\\ngreatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion\\nof sin in the exchange between A and B.\\n\\nMr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor\\'s B,\\nthen my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what-\\never personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense\\nattorney.  So, \"one possibility\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in\\nmay others.  At the other extreme, the \"persuasion\" will succeed when it\\nproperly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the\\nInquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that\\nmany of the victims of Inquisition will have \"accepted\" that they were in\\nfact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty\\nof charges brought against them.)\\n\\nThe point is that the \"persuasion\" breaks down when the parties do NOT\\nshare enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main\\nthrust of the Inquisition, against \"heresy\", it is *bound* to break down\\nin precisely the \"worst\" cases.  The \"conservative\" (I don\\'t think that\\nis the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,\\nthat he is \"justified\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to\\na \"greater good.\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow\\nthe gospel, as if one\\'s theories about \"sin\" entitled one to cast aside\\nJesus\\' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).\\n\\nI am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\\n\\n>(Or, for that matter, what does it mean to love one\\'s fellow\\n>man?) And what is the \"right thing\"?  And how does one go about\\n>loving god? \\n\\nWell, the whole *point* of making these the \"base\" commandments is that\\nthey *aren\\'t* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a\\nlaw code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful\\nto individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a\\npersonal involvement in and responsibility for one\\'s actions.  The Great\\nCommandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were\\nGod and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A\\ndemand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping\\nup nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important\\nthat I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \"Conservatives\"\\nmay twist this \"act as if you were God\" to mean \"lay down rules for other\\npeople and be as nasty to them as possible if they don\\'t keep YOUR rules.\"\\nThey are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a\\nlot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy\\nIS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \"against\\nGod\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \"conservatives\" have\\nconfused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other\\npeople with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard\\nAmerican atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.\\n\\n>Ethical systems are not differentiated by the nice sounding goo\\n>up front, much of which sounds pretty much the same, but by the\\n>*specific* acts, procedures, and arguments that they recommend.\\n\\nAnd different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged\\n*different* \"ethical systems\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,\\nit is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular\\n(or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.\\nIt does not have a QU\\'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very\\nlittle, if anything, in the way of \"commandments\" -- so little that\\nthe \"Christians\" who desperately *want* commandments go \"mining\" for\\nthem with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))\\nfor their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus\\nspecifically \"gives\" as \"a commandment\" to us is \"love one another.\"\\n\\n\\t[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson\\n\\t that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that\\n\\t SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I\\'ll\\n\\t point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why\\n\\t there is a huge amount of \"cultural baggage\" involved.]\\n\\nYou are quite right that this is \"goo\" if one is looking for an ethical\\nsystem.\\n\\nBut why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our\\nsociety is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It\\nmay be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems\\n-- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.\\n\\n>I am glad that a few Christians,\\n>such as Michael, find a benign meaning for the goo, and then\\n>interpret the usually ugly specifics in a more constructive\\n>fashion.

       "  'From: jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Josh Hopkins)\\nSubject: RIMSAT, US/Russian joint venture\\nOrganization: University of Illinois at Urbana\\nLines: 121\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I\\'ve \\ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \\ngranted to copy this without restriction.\\n\\nMichael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an\\ninformal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.\\nACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and\\nInternational Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the\\ncompany is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that\\nhis daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.\\n\\nThe concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga\\nto visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,\\nwho happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which \\nthe king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,\\nHis Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought\\nthere probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous\\nsatellite slots.  While this isn\\'t entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,\\nseeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of\\nslots.\\n\\nThe whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl\\nHilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions\\nsupporting Tonga\\'s case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from \\n70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).\\nAccording to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the\\nworld because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and \\nthe Pacific Rim. \\n\\nRIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax\\nhaven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to\\nfill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have\\ncost approximately $2 billion.  It\\'s not easy to raise that kind of money.\\nEventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began \\nnegotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in \\nMoscow in such harsh terms that I don\\'t think I\\'ll visit there for a long time.\\nBesides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way\\nthat people operate.  For example \"everybody can sell you everything.\"  \\nEveryone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the\\nonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.\\n\\nEventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost\\nof $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg\\nsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who \\nwent to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was\\nout of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He\\nagain described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,\\nhe worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the \\nRussian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions\\nbefore signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to \\nallow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.\\n\\nThe next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied \\nMechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in \\nSiberia (can\\'t figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built\\nabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that\\nsiberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest\\npeople who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this\\npoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on\\nboth siberians and midwesterners :-)\\n\\nSternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is \\napparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that\\nwould sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them \\nspecifications, they\\'ll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites\\nthat RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This\\ncompares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1\\nmillion compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their \\nsatellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They \\nhave the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give\\nyou their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are\\ngetting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place\\nnow.\\n\\nTidbits:\\n\\n*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big\\nbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there, except\\nthat \"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\"\\n\\n*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch\\nwithin 9 months.\\n\\n*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement\\nfund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,\\nand a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is\\nsort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.\\n\\n*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried\\npartly because we aren\\'t used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying\\nmonolith.  Italy gets a new government \"every two weeks\" but we don\\'t worry \\nbecause we\\'re used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what\\nreally goes on in Russia we won\\'t worry about their stability as much.\\n\\n*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering\\nmoney.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting\\n25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \"equivalent\" value in \\nrubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian\\nbank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that\\nthe only the contractors get swindled by the government.\\n\\n*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western \\nsatellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type\\nof satellites, which was rather reassuring.\\n\\n*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive\\ntechnology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have\\na lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare\\nwell with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much \\nshorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the \\ndifference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,\\nshorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer\\ntechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date\\nhardware.\\n\\n-- \\nJosh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\\n\\t\\t    \"Find a way or make one.\"\\n\\t             -attributed to Hannibal\\n',\n",

We have been using our processes since way before Challenger.  Challenger\\n   in and of it self did not uncover flaws.\\n\\n2. What Mr. Spencer says is by and large true.  We have a process that is\\n   not dependent on \"sophisticated tools\"  (CASE tools?).  However, tools\\n   cannot fix a bad process.  Also, tool support for HAL/S (the Shuttle\\n   Language) is somewhat limited.\\n\\n3.

This\\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\\n   Consider deleting these edges.\\n\\n1) Now, there are two goals:\\n\\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\\'s)\\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \\n       using the digitized (x,y)\\'s).\\n\\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\\n   example:\\n\\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\\n       Reference(x,y). \\n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \\n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\\n\\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\\n\\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\\nof the edges.\\n\\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\\nobserved (essentially, you can\\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\\nyou can\\'t allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \\nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.

He is the Prophet who is revealed\\nthe last Holy Scripture, Qur\\'an, by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him)\\nthrough the Arch Angel Gabriel.  He is the seal of all prophets\\ntill the day of judgement as stated in the Qur\\'an by Allah\\nSWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between\\n571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW,\\nis a treason against Islam, against Qur\\'an, against the message\\nof Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another\\nmessenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah.\\nHe is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his\\ncoming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur\\'an is from \\nChapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:\\n\\n\\tMuhammad is not the father of any of your men,\\n\\tbut (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal\\n\\tof the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of\\n\\tall things.\\n\\n---------------------\\nCommentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed,\\nit is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The \\nHoly Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers.\\nAllah\\'s teaching is and will always be continuous, but there\\nhas been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later\\nages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not\\nan arbitrary matter.  It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom,\\n\"for Allah has full knowledge of all things.\"\\n\\n----------------------\\nDROPLET VOL 1, No 11, Part 2\\n\\nA   D R O P L E T\\nFrom The Vast Ocean Of The Miraculous Qur\\'an\\n\\nTranslations from the Arabic and Turkish Writings of \\nBediuzzaman Said Nursi, The Risale-i Noor\\n\\nVOL 1, No 11, Part 2\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n   \\t\\t NINETEENTH LETTER  \\n\\n\\t\\t MU\\'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI \\n(A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW)       \\n\\n(continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 1)\\n\\n   SECOND  SIGN:   The  Noble  Messenger  (SAW)\\ndeclared His prophethood, and presented to humanity a\\ndecree as the Glorious Qur\\'an and manifest miracles\\nwhich number, according to the scholars, one thousand.\\nThe occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as\\ncertain as the fact that He declared himself prophet.  In\\nfact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate\\nunbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise\\nOur\\'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His\\nmiracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids) \\nsorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their\\nfollowers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the\\ncertainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars\\nof Islam) to the hundreth degree.\\n   The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of\\nthe universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the\\neffect of the words,\\'You have indeed spoken the truth !\\'\\n   Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler,\\nwhile being observed by Him, \\'The true ruler has\\nappointed me to such and such position.  \\'At a time when\\nyou were asked to prove your claim, the word \\'Yes\\'\\nuttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if\\nthe ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your\\nrequest, this would confirm your claim even more soundly\\nand more definitely than would the word \\'Yes.\\'\\n   In the same way, ALLAH\\'s Most Noble Messenger\\nclaimed: \\'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this\\nuniverse.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken\\norder at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my\\nfingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five\\nspigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He\\nsplits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear\\nwitness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at\\nthis food: although it is barely enough for two or three\\nmen, it satisfies two or three hundred.  \\'Further he shows\\nhundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of\\nthe veracity of this high being and the proofs of his\\nprophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his\\ndeeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral\\nconduct and manners, his character and appearance\\nprove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness.\\nIndeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the\\nfamous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief\\nmerely by seeing him, and said, \\'No lie can hide in this\\nface, nor can any fraud be found in it!\\'\\n   Although many of the  researchers have concluded\\nthat the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his\\nmiracles number about one thousand, there are\\nthousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of\\nhis prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of\\ntruth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions\\nhave affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of\\nways.\\n   The Wise Our\\'an alone demonstrates thousands of\\nthe proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty\\naspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a\\nphenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of\\nindividuals who claimed prophethood and performed\\nmiracles have lived and passed away; then, the\\nprophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity\\nsuperior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For\\nwhatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the\\nmeans of the prophethood and messengership of all the\\nmessengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they\\nare all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive\\nfashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and\\nmeans of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the\\nperson of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found\\nin him with more certanity than all the other prophets.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\nTo be Continued Allah Willing.\\nIrfan Alan, A Servant of Islam.\\n\\n',\n",

According to\\nthem they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised\\nKoresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                 \\n The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out.\\nHis grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh\\'s Real name)  she didn\\'t raise\\nDavid Koresh.\"\\n\\nSomeone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a\\nlogical level.

Now they claim they never thought he would do it?\\n\\nI knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how\\nmuch money this was costing.

It is considered \"Cruel and Unusal Punishment\" to\\nexecute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what\\'s acceptable.\\n\\nThey knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not\\nsure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the \\ncompound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were\\nsupposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.\\n\\nI spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR\\n(Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training\\nis going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were\\nsubjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical \\nagent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.\\n\\nI have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of\\nthing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.\\n\\nWe waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these\\npeople 51 days.  \\n\\nI stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole\\nthing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks\\nchanged my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:\\n\\n\"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the\\noperation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal\\nshot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.\"\\n\\nIt took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.\\n\\nOne more thought.

I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to\\n  take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive\\n  word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS \\n  netters will be amiable in their explanation.)\\n\\nSince it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin\\nof the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say \"no good\"\\nbecause it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not \\nthe authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time \\nbefore I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England, \\nProfessor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the \\nfollowing as part of a book review section in This People\\'s magazine (Spring \\n1993 edition):\\n\\n  \"I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--\\n  or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other \\n  with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian \\n  or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around\\n  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude\\n  those who don\\'t fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central\\n  defining characteristic of a good American might be \"one who doesn\\'t draw\\n  exclusive circles\" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the \\n  central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to\\n  draw a circle around \"Mormon\" or \"Christian,\" to decide who is \"orthodox\"\\n  and who isn\\'t by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider\\n  that the central pillar of Christ\\'s \"orthodoxy\" is our ability to love\\n  unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.\\n\\n  \"I recently spent some time in a \"Christian\" bookstore in California. The\\n  service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and\\n  well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural\\n  commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.\\n  But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking \\n  others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American\\n  culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to \"Cults and the\\n  Occult,\" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same\\n  rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found\\n  I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers\\n  (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous\\n  anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations\\n  of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).\\n\\n  \"It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to\\n  Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (\"Perfect\\n  love casteth out fear,\" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the\\n  LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a \\n  disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the\\n  same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive\\n  action---as the \"religious right wing\" has launched this year against the\\n  political left and American cultural and religious styles they don\\'t like.\\n  It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the\\n  very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,\\n  if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons\\' rights along with those of\\n  others they believe to be evil.\"\\n\\n\\nThe above \"sermon\" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe\\nto This People\\'s magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who\\nrely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His\\narms.  \\n\\nEven though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles \\nof the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim \\nperfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do \\nnow lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled \"Christian\", if \\nthose who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are \\nintollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical \\nscriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication \\nthan mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the \\nmajority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective \\nvoice is louder.  That\\'s really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand\\non in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter \\nthe LDS Church\\' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths \\nand non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to \\ndisprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves. \\nLet us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion \\nand conversation, thereby uplifting everyone.  \\n\\n \\nHal Leifson -- signing off!\\n',\n",

No!  Of\\ncourse not.\\n\\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for\\nyou.  The Qur\\'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \"I am a\\nMuslim\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean\\nthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?

Many of the Kaiser\\'s friends\\nwere prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long\\ntradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -\\nback to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a \\nproduct of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the\\nEnglish public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,\\nwould have been quite willing to overlook Roehm\\'s homosexuality.\\n\\nIn addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth.

       "  'From: jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Josh Hopkins)\\nSubject: DC-Y trajectory simulation\\nKeywords: SSTO, Delta Clipper\\nOrganization: University of Illinois at Urbana\\nLines: 91\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I\\'ve \\ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \\ngranted to copy this without restriction.\\n\\nNote for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a\\nsingle staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3\\nscale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is \\ncurrently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale \\nexperimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.\\n\\nOn April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled \\n\"Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions\" here at the University of\\nIllinois. Mr Nelson\\'s job involves using software to simulate trajectories and\\ndetermine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is\\nnot directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with \\nthem recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used \\nthe DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don\\'t think the details\\nof implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope\\nthey aren\\'t - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will\\nbe interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.\\n\\nThe first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The\\nmain restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that\\nthis is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I\\ndid not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters\\nand 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in \\nmid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson\\nshowed the following plot of acceleration vs time:\\n                  ______\\n3 G         /|   /      |\\n           / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly \\n          /  | /        |\\t   good.  The big difference is that the lines\\n2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are\\n        /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as\\n       /                |          the graph wasn\\'t up for very long.\\n1 G   /                 |\\n                        |\\n                        |\\n0 G                     |\\n\\n             ^          ^\\n           ~100 sec    ~400 sec\\n\\n\\nAs mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below\\n3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the\\naccelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are \\nthrotled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it\\nsoon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in \\naccelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines\\nbring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut\\nout entirely.\\n\\nThe engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed\\nfor an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of\\nair drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to \\nthat desired.\\n\\nQuestions from the audience:  (paraphrased)\\n\\nQ:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than\\n    all at once?\\n\\nA:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.\\n\\nQ:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?\\n\\nA:  Can\\'t tell us.  \"Read Aviation Leak.\"  He also apparently had a good \\n    propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  \\n\\nMy question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting\\nnational security or MD protecting their own interests?\\n\\nThe second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch\\nup maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and \\nthe parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs\\nof heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,\\nand I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate.\\nThe end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have\\nabout 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it\\'s reentry profile about \\n60 degrees south latitude.\\n\\nI would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn\\'t know about that\\naspect of the flight profile.\\n\\n-- \\nJosh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\\n\\t\\t    \"Find a way or make one.\"\\n\\t             -attributed to Hannibal\\n',\n",

It uses few calculations however, basically it is several\\ncomparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the\\ntransformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the\\nscreen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My\\nmethod basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the\\nscreen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of\\nsomething, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so\\nmerely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are\\nlooking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.

Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of references might be:\\n\\n1.

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire\\ncelestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)\\nswing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.\\n\\n2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked\\nto the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity\\nfrom April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay\\nAntenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to\\n11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.\\n\\n3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss\\ntimer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify\\nthe health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment\\ndata; long term trend analysis is continuing.\\n\\n6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the\\noptimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary\\nanalysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation\\nindex is near the optimal level.\\n\\n7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.\\nPreliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.\\n\\n8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster\\nflushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed\\nduring the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.\\n\\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant\\nchanges (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads\\n19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These\\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\\nanomaly team.\\n\\n10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:\\n\\n       a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts\\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees\\n           off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)\\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\\n           Time To Initiation - 260 hours\\n\\n\\nGDS (Ground Data Systems):\\n\\n1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test\\nfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21\\n(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify\\nthe flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller\\n(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement\\nfor the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry\\nrates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry\\nSubsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The\\n10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was\\nnot metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS\\ndata from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of\\nthe TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.\\n\\n\\nTRAJECTORY\\n\\n     As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\\nstatus was as follows:\\n\\n\\tDistance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)\\n\\tDistance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)\\n\\tHeliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour\\n\\tDistance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km\\n\\tRound Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds\\n\\n\\nSPECIAL TOPIC\\n\\n1.

       "  'From: ed@cwis.unomaha.edu (Ed Stastny)\\nSubject: The OTIS Project (FTP sites for original art and images)\\nKeywords: Mr.Owl, how many licks...\\nOrganization: University of Nebraska at Omaha\\nLines: 227\\n\\n\\n\\t-------------------------------------\\n\\t+ ............The OTIS Project \\'93  +      \\n\\t+ \"The Operative Term Is STIMULATE\" + \\n\\t-------------------------------------\\n\\t---this file last updated..4-21-93---\\n\\n\\nWHAT IS OTIS?\\n\\nOTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork\\nand photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,    \\nand distribution.  Digital immortality.\\n\\nThe basic idea behind \"digital immortality\" is that computer networks   \\nare here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them\\nwill be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the\\nartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they\\'ll be put in different\\nformats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they\\'ll be\\nthere...and someone will dig them up.  \\n \\nIf that doesn\\'t interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique\\nand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes\\nand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang\\nas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is \\nbreathed into your work...and by merit of it\\'s stimulus, it will \\ntravel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.\\n \\nSpectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and \\nlet the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own\\ncopies of the images to look at when you\\'ve got the gumption...\\nthat\\'s what they\\'re here for.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWHERE?             \\n\\nOTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  \\n \\n \\t141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tsunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite \\n\\t(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)\\n\\nMerely \"anonymous FTP\" to either site on Internet and change to the\\nappropriate directory.  Don\\'t forget to get busy and use the \"bin\"\\ncommand to make sure you\\'re in binary.\\n\\nOTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North\\nAmerica....the following systems have a substancial supply of\\nOTIStuff...\\n\\tUnderground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines\\n\\tCyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n \\nHOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?\\n              \\nWhat happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   \\nphoto, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put\\nit in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me\\n(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,\\nit will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works\\nare also welcome.\\n\\nOTIS\\' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \\nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \\nsee.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at \\nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\\ntougher to find.  If you can\\'t find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \\nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \\nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \\n\\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \\n\\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we\\'ll\\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \\ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \\nemailing).\\n\\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send\\ncopies to:\\n\\nThe OTIS Project\\nc/o Ed Stastny\\nPO BX 241113\\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113\\n\\nI will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  \\nscan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \\nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \\ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\\ndirectory where it\\'s finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \\n \\nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\\ncontact me and we\\'ll arrange things.\\n\\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\"\\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\\nThis is good for people who don\\'t have direct access to encoders or FTP,\\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\\nJPG.  If you can\\'t...we can convert from most formats...we\\'d just rather\\nnot have to.\\n\\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\\ncan stand.  Even if you don\\'t have stuff to contribute, you can send\\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \\nget a slab-o-OTIS.\\n\\nAs of 04/21/93, we\\'re at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \\nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISTRIBUTION?\\n\\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \\non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \\nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \\n \\nIt would also be nice if you\\'d send me a note when you did post images\\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\\n\\nIt\\'s the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\\nBBS system....or even just post this \"info-file\" there.  It would be\\nkeen of you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUSE?\\n\\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\\nyou\\'ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \\nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \\nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \\nArtists name.  If permission isn\\'t explicitly given, then you\\'ll have \\nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I\\'ll get in contact with the artist for \\nyou, or give you their contact information.\\n \\nWhen you DO use permitted work, it\\'s always courteous to let the artist\\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\\ncompensation for their files.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNAMING IMAGES?\\n\\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci\\'s fifth mechanical drawing would be something\\nlike:\\n \\n\\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\\n\\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\\nremain intact on all systems.  \\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \\n\\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\\n\\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\\ncase they\\'d like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\\naddress or other information you\\'d like people to know.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHMMM?!\\n\\nThat\\'s about it for now.  More \"guidelines\" will be added as needed.\\nYour input is expected.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  \\n \\t     (a sumerian deity) or it\\'s followers, be they pope, priest,\\n\\t     or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations\\n\\t     however.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original \\n \\t     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.  \\n\\t     It\\'s possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone\\n\\t     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.  \\n    \\t     Unless you\\'ve given permission for that, it\\'s illegal.  OTIS\\n\\t     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights\\n\\t     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to \\n\\t     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed \\n\\t     electronically.

He called them \"the Great Commission\" but this is NOT\\ndescriptive of Jesus\\'s words in Matt. 10:15.\\n\\nMatt. 10:14, Jerusalem Bible translation:\\n\\n\\t\"And if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have\\n\\tto say, as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust\\n\\tfrom your feet.\"\\n\\nMatt. 10:15:\\n\\n \\t\"I tell you solemnly, on the day of Judgment it will not \\n \\tgo as hard with the land of Sodom and Gomorrah as with \\n \\tthat town.\"\\n\\nIn the post to which Dean is referring above, I said:\\n\\n\"> The above is a good description of Kaflowitz, who keeps harping on\\n > shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what Christ said next.\"\\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                                ^^^^\\n\\nThe highlighted words refer to Matt 10:14 and 10:15 respectively.\\n\\nAnd Dean countered:\\n\\n\"Actually, this comment of your\\'s is a perfect example of what an\\nintellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are, since I\\nspecifically acknowledged the Great Commission and the entreaty\\nto spread the word.  In fact, it is the combination of the two\\nstatements I was addressing, and not just the one, and for you to\\ncharacterize that as \"ignoring\" the instruction to spread the\\nword is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are.\"\\n\\nOf course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of \"instruction\\nto spread the word.\"\\n\\nAll these quotes btw are from:\\n\\nMessage-ID: <1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>\\n\\n>in which, at the end, he claims I did not answer a question\\n>which I answered, and which he deleted (to get the chronology\\n>right, he deleted the answer and then said I didn\\'t answer).\\n\\nAnd I claim it correctly, because my question went:\\n\\n\"Do you, too, measure\\nthe goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care not\\na whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?\"\\n\\nand the closest Dean came to an answer was:\\n\\n\"Peter, Peter, Peter.  You\\'re just so stupid, pretentious, dull,\\nand generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that\\nthe sport is all there is.\"\\n\\nOf course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with posts\\nin GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this,\\nyet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:\\n\\n\"So I now restore the answer to your question\\nthat you deleted.  If you\\'re still unable to figure it out, ask\\na nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It really\\ndoesn\\'t take much sophistication to understand.\"\\n\\nOn top of which, I doubt that the \"answer\" is at all representative\\nof Dean\\'s true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thus\\nfar are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean\\'s \\nmind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken.\\nOne wonders whether Dean\\'s mind is so warped as to find sport in all\\nthis.\\n\\nHe even dredges up a falsified account of\\nevents that transpired earlier on another thread:\\n\\n\"You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nwas in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nthe \"sins\" of other individuals.\"\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nFalse.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one\\'s sins.\\nThat I made public announcements of the \"sins\" of others\\n--\"sins\", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in\\nthe posts of others-- is a different matter.\\n\\nMany of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that\\nthey do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so\\nI pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread,\\nYOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.\\n\\nDean again:\\n\\n\"You made an ass of yourself\\nby saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was\\nsomehow an attempt to \"paint Jews as plaster saints,\" thereby\\nrevealing your inability to understand the discussion as well\\nas showing your dislike for people saying positive things\\nabout Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by\\nrepeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then\\nclaiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.\"\\n\\nActually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew\\nwho gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite\\naccording to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing\\nJewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as\\nimplicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.\\n\\nI went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of\\nthe doubt in a post following my initial crack about \"plaster saints\", \\nsuggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.\\n\\nIn an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly\\ndistorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as\\nthe basis of one insult after another.\\n\\nPeter Nyikos\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I purposely used \"handle\" in order to \\navoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there are\\naberrations like \"scientific\" creationism).  I used \"best\" in part to indicate \\nthat science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are\\nmostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the\\nmatter.  As an aside, for science I should have written \"how and when\".  Nobody\\nseems to argue over what.\\n\\n>Are they [theists, theologians] any better equiped to investigate the \"who and \\n>why\" than magicians, astrologers, housewives [not being sexists], athiests or \\n>agnostics.\\n\\nSeems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I\\'m not\\ntrying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works.\\nOn the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which\\nyou know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological\\nperspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I \\nthink the masses can\\'t get along without religion.  Not that generally they are \\nincapable; they just don\\'t, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to \\nbe the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore \\nit seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for \\ndispensing answers to \"who and why\".  I suggest that this holds regardless of \\nthe \"truth\" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.  \\nIn the end, spiritual beliefs are just as \"real\" as scientific facts and \\nexplanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).  \\n\\n>Do you suggest that the \"who and why\" will forever be closed to scientific \\n>investigation?\\n\\nNo.  In fact, I don\\'t think it is closed now, at least for some individuals. \\nIsn\\'t there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was \\ncreated from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might \\npresuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued \\nthat something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn\\'t\\nhave to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that\\'s a tough one for\\npeople today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not \\nexplanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words, \\nI agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific \\nas explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but \\nI sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will \\nbe necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty \\nconvoluted here; I hope I\\'ve made sense.  \\n\\n>It seems to me that 200 or so years ago, the question of the origin of life on\\n>earth was not considered open to scientific enquiry.\\n\\nI agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, \\nwhen, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment, \\nreason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, \\nand not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the \\nnaturalists\\' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely \\nleaving behind the who and why.

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design\\n    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.\\n\\n\\n    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into\\n    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20\\n    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas\\n    scintillation proportional counters.\\n\\n\\n    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint\\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\\'s atmosphere,\\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\\'s\\n    satellites, and characterize Titan\\'s atmosphere and surface.\\n\\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\\n    peer through Titan\\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\\n\\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\\n    Saturn\\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\\n    nature of Saturn\\'s rings.\\n\\n\\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\\n\\t -------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\\n\\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\\n\\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\\n\\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\\n\\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\\n\\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\\n\\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\\n\\n\\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

JPL has developed a backup plan using data\\n    compression (JPEG-like for images, lossless compression for data from\\n    the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve\\n    approximately 70% of its original objectives.\\n\\n\\t   Galileo Schedule\\n\\t   ----------------\\n\\t   10/18/89 - Launch from Space Shuttle\\n\\t   02/09/90 - Venus Flyby\\n\\t   10/**/90 - Venus Data Playback\\n\\t   12/08/90 - 1st Earth Flyby\\n\\t   05/01/91 - High Gain Antenna Unfurled\\n\\t   07/91 - 06/92 - 1st Asteroid Belt Passage\\n\\t   10/29/91 - Asteroid Gaspra Flyby\\n\\t   12/08/92 - 2nd Earth Flyby\\n\\t   05/93 - 11/93 - 2nd Asteroid Belt Passage\\n\\t   08/28/93 - Asteroid Ida Flyby\\n\\t   07/02/95 - Probe Separation\\n\\t   07/09/95 - Orbiter Deflection Maneuver\\n\\t   12/95 - 10/97 - Orbital Tour of Jovian Moons\\n\\t   12/07/95 - Jupiter/Io Encounter\\n\\t   07/18/96 - Ganymede\\n\\t   09/28/96 - Ganymede\\n\\t   12/12/96 - Callisto\\n\\t   01/23/97 - Europa\\n\\t   02/28/97 - Ganymede\\n\\t   04/22/97 - Europa\\n\\t   05/31/97 - Europa\\n\\t   10/05/97 - Jupiter Magnetotail Exploration\\n\\n\\n    HITEN - Japanese (ISAS) lunar probe launched 1/24/90.

The primary objective of the\\n    TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global\\n    observations of the sea level for several years, substantially\\n    increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also\\n    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.\\n\\n\\n    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over\\n    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\\n\\n    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of\\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from\\n    that planet by sliding over Jupiter\\'s north pole in a gravity-assist\\n    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\\'s south pole\\n    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\\'s right, a solar-studies spacecraft\\n    that\\'s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\\n\\n    While in Jupiter\\'s neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\\n    radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see\\n    *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical\\n    detail, see the many articles in the same issue.\\n\\n\\n    OTHER SPACE SCIENCE MISSIONS (note: this is based on a posting by Ron\\n    Baalke in 11/89, with ISAS/NASDA information contributed by Yoshiro\\n    Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).

(Both X Exponent Graphics and C Exponent\\nGraphics are 3GL products).  The beta period is from April 26 through \\nJune 18.  The platform is HP9000/700 running under OS 8.07 with \\nansi C 8.71 compiler.  The media will be sent on 4mm DAT cartridge \\ntape.  Here are some of the key facts about the two products.\\n \\nX Exponent Graphics 1.0 key facts:\\n \\n1. Complete collection of high-level 2D and 3D application plot types\\n   available through a large collection of X resources.\\n2. Cstom widget for OSF/Motif developers.\\n3. Built-in interactive GUI for plot customization.\\n4. Easily-implemented callbacks for customized application feedback.\\n5. XEG 1.0, being built on the Xt Toolkit provides the user a widget \\n   library that conforms to the expected syntax and standards familar \\n   to X programmers.\\n6. XEG will also be sold as a bundle with Visual Edge\\'s UIM/X product.\\n   This will enable user to use a GUI builder to create the graphical\\n   layout of an application.\\n \\nC Exponent Graphics 2.0 key facts:\\n \\n1. Written in C for C application programmers/developers.  The library\\n   is 100% written in C, and the programming interface conforms to C\\n   standards, taking advantage fo the most desirable features of C.\\n2. Build-in GUI for interactive plot customization.  Through mouse \\n   interaction, the user has complete interactive graph output control\\n   with over 200 graphics attributes for plot customization.\\n3. Large collection of high-level application functions for \"two-call\"\\n   graph creation.  A wide variety of 2D and 3D plot types are available\\n   with minimal programming effort.\\n4. User ability to interrupt and control the X event.  By controlling\\n   the X event loop, when the user use the mouse to manipulate the  plot\\n   the user can allow CEG to control the event loop or the user can \\n   control the event loop.\\n \\nIf anyone is interested in beta testing either of the products, please\\ncontact Wendy Hou at Visual Numerics via email at hou@imsl.com or call\\n713-279-1066.\\n \\n \\n-- \\nJaclyn Brandt\\njbrandt@NeoSoft.com\\n--\\n',\n",

Larson\\'s comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \\n          calls the \"Reciprocal System\", is built on two fundamental \\n          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of \\n          space and time: \\n    \\n               (1) \"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \\n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \\n          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\" \\n    \\n               (2) \"The physical universe conforms to the relations of \\n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are \\n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\" \\n    \\n               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE \\n          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of \\n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-\\n          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward \\n          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light \\n          (which Larson called \"UNIT VELOCITY\" and \"THE NATURAL \\n          DATUM\"). \\n      \\n               At each step in the development, Larson was able to \\n          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the \\n          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles \\n          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star \\n          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white \\n          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET \\n          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY \\n          BURSTS). \\n          \\n               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, \\n          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-\\n          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility \\n          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of \\n          matter. \\n\\n               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy \\n          complex mathematics, in his books. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          BOOKS of Dewey B.

Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the \\n          organization that was started to promote Larson\\'s Theory.  \\n          They have other related publications, including the quarterly \\n          journal \"RECIPROCITY\". \\n\\n          \\n\\n          Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s Background\\n    \\n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \\n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \\n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \\n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \\n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \\n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one \\n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \\n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \\n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \\n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \\n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \\n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \\n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \\n     \\n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \\n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \\n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \\n          researchers\\' experimental and observational data.  And in \\n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \\n    \\n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \\n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \\n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \\n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \\n    \\n               \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe \\n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson\\'s books are FULL of \\n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \\n          agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \\n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \\n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \\n    \\n    \\n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \\n          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson\\'s Theory, and was (or \\n          still is) President of Larson\\'s organization, \"THE \\n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of \\n          their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".  He moved to \\n          Minneapolis after retiring. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          \"Super Collider\" BOONDOGGLE!\\n          \\n               I am AGAINST contruction of the \"Superconducting Super \\n          Collider\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \\n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \"scientific\" \\n          value. \\n    \\n               Most physicists don\\'t realize it, but, according to the \\n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \\n          particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.) \\n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \\n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \\n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \\n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \\n          with their environment. \\n    \\n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \\n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \\n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \\n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \\n    \\n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \\n          BILLION cost?!!  Don\\'t we have much more important uses for \\n          this WASTED money?! \\n    \\n     \\n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \\n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \\n          kind of \"fire ants\" eating the insulation off underground \\n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \\n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \\n          the \"Supercollider\"?! \\n    \\n          \\n               Naming the \"Super Collider\" after Ronald Reagon, as \\n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \\n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \\n      \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\\n          \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \\n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \\n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \\n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \\n          which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\". \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \\n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \\n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \\n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \\n          other. \\n      \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \\n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \\n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \\n          MATERIAL half. \\n       \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\\n          \\n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \\n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \\n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \\n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \\n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \\n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \\n          help \"prove\" Einstein\\'s \"General Theory of Relativity\". \\n    \\n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \\n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by \\n          INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his \\n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \\n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \\n    \\n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special \\n          Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \\n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \\n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \\n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \\n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \\n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \\n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \\n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \\n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \\n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \\n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \\n          [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing \\n          about this.] \\n    \\n     \\n               In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in \\n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \\n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \\n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \\n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson\\'s Theory, \\n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \\n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \\n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \\n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \\n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \\n          the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \\n          FANTASY). \\n    \\n                                    \\n          \\n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\n\\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE \\n          OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \\n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \\n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \\n    \\n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \\n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \\n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \\n    \\n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \\n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \\n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \\n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \\n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \\n    \\n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \\n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \\n          OPEN MINDS! \\n    \\n               The following is an example of his Theory\\'s success: \\n          In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \\n          UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \\n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \\n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\\'s \\n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \\n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \\n    \\n\\n \\n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\\n\\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \\n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \\n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \\n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \\n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \\n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \\n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \\n          directional coincidence). \\n    \\n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \\n          his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the \\n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \\n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \\n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \\n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \\n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \\n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \\n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \\n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \\n          directions uniformly.) \\n    \\n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \\n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \\n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \\n          stop it! \\n    \\n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \\n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \\n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\\n          \\n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \\n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \\n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \\n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \\n    \\n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \\n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \\n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \\n          B. Larson. \\n    \\n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \\n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \\n          and in some of his other books. \\n    \\n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \\n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow \\n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \\n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \\n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \\n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star\\'s internal \\n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \\n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \\n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \\n          lighter elements. \\n    \\n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \\n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \\n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \\n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \\n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \\n          of his books [better than I can]. \\n    \\n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \\n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \\n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \\n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \\n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \\n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \\n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \\n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \\n    \\n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \\n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \\n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \\n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \\n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \\n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R \\n          Diagram. \\n    \\n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \\n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \\n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \\n          system, orbiting each other. \\n     \\n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \\n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \\n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \\n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \\n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\\n\\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \\n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \\n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \\n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \\n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \\n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \\n      \\n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \\n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \\n          his own version of Bode\\'s Law. \\n          \\n\\n\\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\\n\\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \\n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black \\n          holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and \\n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than \\n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \\n    \\n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \\n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black \\n          holes\", etc.! \\n    \\n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s books about \\n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is \\n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \\n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black \\n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \\n          to \"prove\" their theory. \\n    \\n    \\n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \\n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \\n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking\\'s severe physical \\n          problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT! \\n    \\n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \\n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson\\'s \\n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \\n          Unified Science). \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\\n\\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \\n          with UFO\\'s and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \\n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \\n    \\n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \\n          pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \\n          Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \\n    \\n               \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \\n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \\n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \\n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \\n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson\\'s book \"NOTHING BUT \\n          MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \\n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \\n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \\n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \\n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \\n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \\n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \\n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \\n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \\n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \\n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \\n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \\n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \\n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \\n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \\n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \\n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \\n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \\n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \\n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \\n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \\n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \\n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \\n          \\n               Note that in Larson\\'s Theory, UNcharged electrons are \\n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \\n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \\n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \\n          (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \\n          according to Larson\\'s Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and \\n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \\n    \\n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \\n          light! \\n    \\n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \\n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \\n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \\n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \\n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson\\'s Theory, an electrical charge \\n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \\n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \\n          rotation of the particle.) \\n      \\n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \\n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \\n          generated in clouds. \\n\\n\\n\\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\\n\\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has \\n          been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in \\n          his first book \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\". \\n    \\n               It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan, \\n          and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call \\n          \"science\" (or \"physics\", or \"astronomy\", etc.), as well as \\n          the \"scientific\" literature and the \"education\" systems, to \\n          TOTALLY IGNORE Larson\\'s Theory has they have. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s Theory has excellent explanations for many \\n          things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such \\n          as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY \\n          discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, \\n          in the U.S. and elsewhere.

First, in February, the Russians deployed a\\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this \"Banner\" reflector was blank,\\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the \"Environmental\\nBillboard\".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the \"Environmental\\nBillboard\" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\\ndeployed by the inflatable \\'frame\\'.\\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry \"ozone reading\\nsensors\" to \"continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\\'s\\ndelicate protective ozone layer,\" according to Mike Lawson, head of\\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\\'s\\natmosphere. According to IMI, \"as the biodegradable material burns,\\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\\nreplenish the ozone layer.\" The remaining spacecraft will monitor\\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\\nup and \"adds to the ozone supply.\"\\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \\'unit\\' cost\\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\\n  \\nBut back to Brian\\'s questions:\\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the \"wild\\n>idea\" stage or does it have real funding?\\n  \\n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\\'t piggy back upon\\nsomeone else\\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\\nlaunch.  That\\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\\'t think the\\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\\nand no, I don\\'t really like the idea of this additional light\\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\\nidiot?)\\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\\'s in a low\\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\\'s the time\\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\\'t heard of any serious funding\\nfor this, but I\\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\\n  \\n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\\nmy guest.  I don\\'t have posting privileges to that area (or at least\\nI don\\'t THINK I do...).\\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor\\n\\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\\n',\n",

What, you may ask, does gas guns\\nhave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically\\nlocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,\\nand the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)\\nfrom which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the\\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\\n\\nI visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.\\nAt the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,\\nbut I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\\n\\nThe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\\nThe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\\nhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston\\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\\nof atmospheres.\\n\\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\\nand about 50 cm long.\\n\\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \\n\\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\\nthe projectile vaporizes.\\n\\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\\nto follow the projectiles.\\n\\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\\nkm/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,\\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\\nI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\\n\\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\\n4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\\n\\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\\nsized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of\\n100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg\\nuseful payload to orbit.\\n\\nDani Eder\\n\\n-- \\nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\\n\",\n",

Without delving into a deep discussion of\\n: >>creationism vs evolutionism, God created the original genetic code\\n: >>perfect and without flaw. \\n: >  ~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~ ~~~~\\n\\nDo you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect, and\\nhas degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour\\nof this statement, shouldn\\'t we?\\n\\nPerhaps the biggest \"imperfection\" of the code is that it is full\\nof non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they\\nintervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of\\nevidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is\\nlikely that early exons represented early protein domains.\\n\\nIs the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that\\nintron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually\\nhave quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes. \\n\\nOn the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted\\nlater, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed\\nby a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,\\nif introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have\\nrequired _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,\\nsince sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are\\nconserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a\\ntrace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and\\nthese are not found in or near intron sequences. \\n\\nI seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and\\ngenetics before posting \"theological arguments\" like this. \\nTry Watson\\'s Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish\\n& Baltimore\\'s Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.\\n\\n: Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does\\n: God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a\\n: theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely\\n: scientific perspective, just different.\\n\\nScientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas \\ntheological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.\\n \\n: I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect,\\n: but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.\\n\\nFor the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support\\nyour assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific\\nperspective, unless you support it by some evidence.\\n\\nIn fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps\\nmore important than we\\'ve thought - for instance, sex might\\nhave evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by\\ncomputer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.) \\n \\n: Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma\\n: rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.\\n\\nIn fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although\\nit is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action. \\n\\n: Actually, neither of us \"knows\" what the atmosphere was like at the\\n: time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most\\n: biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after\\n: all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth\\n: was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I\\n: seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for\\n: the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?\\n\\nI\\'d replace \"created\" with \"formed\", since there is no need to \\ninvoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one.\\nMost recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8\\nbillion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but\\norganic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years.\\nThis would leave more than billion years for the first cells to\\nevolve.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry I can\\'t give any references, this is based on the course\\non evolutionary biochemistry I attended here. \\n\\n: >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer\\n: >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of\\n: >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the\\n: >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.  \\n\\nAgain, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for\\nthis supposed \"degeneration\"? \\n\\nI can understand Scott\\'s reaction:\\n\\n: > Excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that I know you must be\\n: > jesting.  Do you know what pathogens are?  Do you know what \\n: > Point Mutations are?  Do you know that EVERYTHING CAN COME\\n: > ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY?!!!!!  \\n: \\n: In response to your last statement, no, and neither do you.\\n: You may very well believe that and accept it as fact, but you\\n: cannot *know* that.\\n\\nI hope you don\\'t forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests \\neverything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against\\nthis conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in \\nanything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the \\nright path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so,\\nand not to present one\\'s own conclusions prior to this. \\n\\nTheology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt\\nit could ever come to right conclusions.\\n\\n: >>Human DNA, being more \"complex\", tends to accumulate errors adversely\\n: >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the \\n: >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in \\n: >>causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence\\n: >>we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial\\n: >>diseases/disorders.\\n\\nYou are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses\\ndo not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of\\na general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators\\nfrom degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to \\nsurvive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn\\'t make it \\nto the present. \\n\\nAnd for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that\\nhuman DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have\\nclaimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection,\\nand thus are bound to degrade. I haven\\'t seen much evidence for either\\nclaim.\\n \\n: But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in\\n: answering John\\'s question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases,\\n: and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require\\n: babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God\\'s fault? (the original\\n: question) -- I say no, it is not.\\n\\nOf course, nothing \"evil\" is god\\'s fault.  But your explanation does\\nnot work, it fails miserably.\\n \\n: You may be right.  But the fact is that you don\\'t know that\\n: Satan is not responsible, and neither do I.\\n: \\n: Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it\\n: be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills\\n: that affect mankind?  I don\\'t think so.\\n\\nHe could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is,\\nit seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are\\njust as inevitable as any product of evolution.\\n\\n: Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference.\\n: Actually what you\\'ve done is to oversimplify what I said to the\\n: point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I\\n: never said that people are \"meant\" (presumably by God) \"to be\\n: punished by getting diseases\".  Why I did say is that free moral\\n: choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject\\n: God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not\\n: expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic\\n: universe.\\n\\nI am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone.\\nI would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed\\nfree. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer\\nis not as clear-cut as it seems to be.\\n\\nWhat consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?\\n  \\n: Oh, I admit it\\'s not perfect (yet).  But I\\'m working on it.  :)\\n\\nA good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.\\n\\n: What does this have to do with the price of tea in China, or the\\n: question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are\\n: fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain\\n: *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don\\'t explain\\n: the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.\\n\\nWhy is there a \"why behind\"? And your proposition was something\\nthat is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend\\nthese books.\\n\\nIs there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence\\nfor this? If the whole universe can come into existence without\\nany intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al)\\nsuggest, why do people still insist on this?\\n \\n: Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.

Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois.\\nEnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in\\nmatters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our\\nenvironment.\\n \\nIncorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and\\ninitial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to\\nCritz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and\\nObjectives:\\n \\n                           MISSION\\n \\n   It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members\\n   to foster and implement the improved education of young\\n   people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards\\n   of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition\\n   than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,\\n   moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue\\n   the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall\\n   seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the\\n   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,\\n   improvement, and responsible use of the environment in\\n   which we must all live.\\n \\n                         OBJECTIVES\\n \\n   In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary\\n   objectives shall be:\\n       (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many\\n            environmentally concerned organizations as\\n            possible, said Movement having as its primary\\n            focus the education and participatory\\n            involvement of young people in appropriate areas\\n            of environmental concern;\\n       (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and\\n            their branches a full complement of program\\n            materials for their use, including suitable\\n            uniforms, insignia and other badges, written\\n            ideas, syllabi and information, literature and\\n            other items as shall seem appropriate and\\n            desirable;\\n       (3)  To serve as a \"clearing house\" for the exchange\\n            of program ideas, materials and information\\n            among said organizations;  and\\n       (4)  To assist environmentally concerned\\n            organizations to recruit and train the necessary\\n            adult leadership for their youth programs.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate through three \"Program Divisions\" serving youth in\\nthe elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be\\nthrough formation of \"EnviroLeague Teams,\" either by EnviroLeague itself or by\\nenvironmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a\\ncharter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.\\n \\nEnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders\\nof each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to\\nmembership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper\\nconduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain\\nadditional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such\\norganizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as\\npossible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to\\nyouth membership.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to\\ncontribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its\\nTeams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any\\nlocal administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be\\ninvolved in similar functions at the national level.\\n \\nProgram materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the \"draft\"\\nportions of the Mentor\\'s Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the\\nEARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes\\nplace.\\n \\nCompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague\\'s founder chose this\\nelectronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.\\nThis announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH\\nForums.\\n \\nThe electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe\\'s Earth Forum - GO\\nEARTH - message and library areas 17, both named \"EnviroLeague.\"\\n============================================================================\\n \\nSubsequently, EnviroLeague\\'s Initial Governance Council has held its first\\nmeeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian\\n(equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home\\n(309) 675-4483 in case of real need.  Also, mail can be addressed to:\\n       EnviroLeague\\n       P.O.

Gay people are and will\\ncon- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may\\nbe unaware of all the statistica \"findings\" concerning African-Americans that\\nhave been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias\\nagainst African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances,\\nbut there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public\\nscoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case.\\nFortunately African-Americans had \"whites\" who supported their \\'cause\\' and\\npublic sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was\\neven a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws\\nwere put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty\\nmuch legal to discriminate against them.\\n\\nI know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free\\nform discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something,\\nthat is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)\\nopenly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society,\\nincluding gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation\\nand making disciples.  We believe in the Lord\\'s great commandment to Love,\\nand we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular\\nto do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a\\nchurch almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes\\nin the commandment of Love (though I\\'m hard-pressed to find many who actually\\nsho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially\\nwithin their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian\\ncommunity for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists\\nagainst the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and\\ntreated as runaway slaves for being \"nigger-lovers\" and such.  I guess I\\'ve\\ndecided the challenge is worth it.\\n\\nIn my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic\\nstory centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight\\nwho have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don\\'t know of one\\ncase where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject\\ntheir gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they\\nbegan to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.\\n\\nI\\'m apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0\\nraged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values\\nCoalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner\\nsupport within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more\\noppressive legisation against gays.\\n\\nPerhaps you don\\'t get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn\\'t get it in the\\nMiddle Ages and the proclaimed God\\'s will be done as they massacred thousands\\nin witch hunts and inquisitions.\\n\\nThe message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay\\nrights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even\\nhatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn\\'t change\\nthe results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the\\nfinal effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a\\n\"conditional\" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we\\'ll love you. This is\\nsure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an \"unconditional\"\\nlove, one that calls people \"just as they are.\"  Sure there are things that\\nwill \\'naturally\\' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that\\nneed to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things\\nlike left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is\\ngoing to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to \"other\\npeople\\'s expectations.\" In the process this coerced conformity causes many\\npeople a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have\\nnothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their\\nown sense of pseuper-spirituality.\\n\\nThis is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be\\nunpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with\\nsomething very personal like \\'sexuality\\' (a taboo subject even today), but I\\nfirmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation\\non thier bedrooms.  It\\'s funny that most straight people have successfully\\nremoved restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,\\nbut we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it\\nhelps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.\\nGay people are not criminals.\\n\\nAnother interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic\\nchurch in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it\\'s pastors arrested for self-\\nadmitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently\\nbeen going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were\\nvoluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that\\nwas how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing\\nhappen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends\\nrecently told me he was \"approached\" by someone who is going through the\\nreparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for\\ndinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.\\n\\nThese are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and\\ncreating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not\\nthe call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in\\nColorado has created an organization who\\'s posters are appearing all over\\nColorado called \"S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T.\" (I forget the whole definition off hand,\\nbut the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto\\nis \"Working for a fag-free America\" with an implicit advocation for violence.\\n\\nThis is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are\\nembracing.\\n\\nWe Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression\\ntowards those we feel don\\'t \\'measure up\\', and constant beratement from\\norganizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good\\npurpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of\\nexcluding people.\\n\\nThe Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to \"include\"\\npeople.  I have several of Dr. Martin\\'s books and find them quite helpful,\\nespecially concerning \\'cults.\\' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto\\nitself.  Why don\\'t we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people\\nto Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?\\n\\nWhatever\\n\\nRich :-(\\n',\n",

In pre-pill\\n: and pre-condom days, if you had sex there was the chance of producing children.\\n: These days is just ain\\'t true!  People can decide whether or not to have \\n: children and when.

I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the\\n256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video\\nsignal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they\\ndid say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but\\nthey didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they\\nwould call Japan, etc.\\n\\nFrankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images\\nfrom the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.

The split\\nbetween the train and test set is based upon a messages posted before\\nand after a specific date.\\n\\nThis module contains two loaders. The first one,\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\\nextractors such as :class:`sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\\nextractor.\\n\\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\\n\\n    =================   ==========\\n    Classes                     20\\n    Samples total            18846\\n    Dimensionality               1\\n    Features                  text\\n    =================   ==========\\n\\nUsage\\n~~~~~\\n\\nThe :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function is a data\\nfetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from\\nthe original `20 newsgroups website`_, extracts the archive contents\\nin the ``~/scikit_learn_data/20news_home`` folder and calls the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.load_files` on either the training or\\ntesting set folder, or both of them::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\')\\n\\n  >>> from pprint import pprint\\n  >>> pprint(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\',\\n   \\'comp.graphics\\',\\n   \\'comp.os.ms-windows.misc\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.mac.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.windows.x\\',\\n   \\'misc.forsale\\',\\n   \\'rec.autos\\',\\n   \\'rec.motorcycles\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.baseball\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.hockey\\',\\n   \\'sci.crypt\\',\\n   \\'sci.electronics\\',\\n   \\'sci.med\\',\\n   \\'sci.space\\',\\n   \\'soc.religion.christian\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.guns\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.mideast\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.misc\\',\\n   \\'talk.religion.misc\\']\\n\\nThe real data lies in the ``filenames`` and ``target`` attributes. The target\\nattribute is the integer index of the category::\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([ 7,  4,  4,  1, 14, 16, 13,  3,  2,  4])\\n\\nIt is possible to load only a sub-selection of the categories by passing the\\nlist of the categories to load to the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function::\\n\\n  >>> cats = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\', categories=cats)\\n\\n  >>> list(newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\\n\\nConverting text to vectors\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIn order to feed predictive or clustering models with the text data,\\none first need to turn the text into vectors of numerical values suitable\\nfor statistical analysis. This can be achieved with the utilities of the\\n``sklearn.feature_extraction.text`` as demonstrated in the following\\nexample that extract `TF-IDF`_ vectors of unigram tokens\\nfrom a subset of 20news::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\\n  >>> categories = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'talk.religion.misc\\',\\n  ...               \\'comp.graphics\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> vectors.shape\\n  (2034, 34118)\\n\\nThe extracted TF-IDF vectors are very sparse, with an average of 159 non-zero\\ncomponents by sample in a more than 30000-dimensional space\\n(less than .5% non-zero features)::\\n\\n  >>> vectors.nnz / float(vectors.shape[0])\\n  159.01327...\\n\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized` is a function which \\nreturns ready-to-use token counts features instead of file names.\\n\\n.. _`20 newsgroups website`: http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/\\n.. _`TF-IDF`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf\\n\\n\\nFiltering text for more realistic training\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIt is easy for a classifier to overfit on particular things that appear in the\\n20 Newsgroups data, such as newsgroup headers. Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this by\\n  setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``. The F-score will be\\n  lower because it is more realistic.\\n\\n.. topic:: Examples\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\\n'}"
