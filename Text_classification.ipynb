Then about three, four years ago I see Rio on the beach in Dubai, so I approached him and said, ‘Have you got five minutes?

    "'LEVY HAS THE UPPER HAND OVER KANE'\n",
    "The Athletic's David Ornstein believes few clubs will be able to afford Daniel Levy's asking price for Harry Kane this summer which may force the striker to stay at Tottenham a little longer.\n",
    "\"He holds some power, but Daniel Levy holds the upper hand because Harry Kane in 2018 signed a new six-year contract, which was fairly extraordinary in its length,\" he said. \"Many people are now looking at that and saying it was misguided.\n",
    "\"There’s a lot of debate in football over whether he should have used one of the super-agents as opposed to his father and brother. Now they’re going to have to try to come to an amicable solution, which doesn’t appear that likely given what we’ve seen from Kane over the last week or so.\n",
    "\"It’s not going to happen quickly because Levy doesn’t need to make a decision yet – knowing him it’ll go right down to the end of the transfer window. But Kane, if he’s going to win major trophies, he’s going to have to leave Tottenham.\n",
    "\"But he’s under contract until 2024 so it’s going to be incredibly difficult. It seems like he’ll keep making some public statements here and there and that is really upsetting the Tottenham hierarchy. They’re not happy with his conduct at all so perhaps that presents a glimmer of hope if Kane’s going to move.\n",
    "\"But Levy will not drop his asking price for anybody. It may open up an English suitor like Manchester City – which he [Levy] had no intention of doing before – but they will have to pay the money. I think that is very unlikely this summer.\"\n",

I want to be the best I can be.\n",
    "\"I never said I'd stay at Spurs for the rest of my career and I've never said I'd leave Spurs. People might say, 'he's desperate for trophies, he needs trophies', but I feel like I've still got almost another career to play.\n",

    "\"I would take a view on going into the Championship,” Lampard told the Daily Mirror.\n",
    "“If it was the right club, the right project for sure. I don’t have an ego where I feel just because I’ve managed in the Champions League, that’s the be all and end all. My year at Derby was such an enjoyable year.”\n",
    "Wilfried Zaha admits he is open to a fresh challenge and would not turn down a move away from Crystal Palace in order to win trophies with a \"top\" club.\n",
    "The 28-year-old came through the academy ranks at Palace and has been one of their most influential players during two stints at the club, but despite having two years remaining on his current deal at Selhurst Park, the forward was intent on departing his boyhood club last summer.\n",
    "Zaha has regularly been linked with a move elsewhere. Paris Saint-Germain and AC Milan were reportedly interested in the Ivory Coast international in the January transfer window while last summer Borussia Dortmund and Monaco were also keen on signing him.\n",
    "After three seasons in the Championship for the Eagles, he joined Manchester United back in 2013 but fell out of favour at Old Trafford, making just four appearances there, and returned to Palace on a permanent deal in 2015 where his career got back on track.\n",
    "However, when asked about his future, Zaha said he would not rule out another departure from the south London side in order to boost ambitions of winning silverware with one of the \"top teams\".\n",
    "With one match remaining for Palace this season, against Liverpool on Sunday live on Sky Sports, outgoing manager Roy Hodgson looks to have guided his side to a mid-table finish.\n",
    "Although Christian Benteke (10) and Eberechi Eze (four) have shared the goalscoring responsibilities in the Premier League this season, it has been suggested that Palace have been overly reliant on goals from Zaha over the last few years in order to avoid relegation.\n",
    "But the forward, who has found the net 68 times in 392 appearances in all competitions for the club, says he just wants to continue to perform well.\n",
    "\"As I've gotten older, I've made myself more effective,\" Zaha said.\n",

Nuno twice took Wolves to seventh, providing moment after memorable moment as the best teams in the lands struggled to deal with his side.\n",
    "There was a double over Manchester City. Magical nights under the Molineux lights as 30,000 cheered on victories over Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool and the rest. There was an FA Cup semi-final and a European run that went all the way to the last eight.\n",

    "Out went Doherty alongside the popular Diogo Jota. In came Nelson Semedo and Fabio Silva, a highly-rated prospect who appeared wildly overpriced at £35m. It never looked likely to be enough to justify a change in approach and injuries soon confirmed it.\n",
    "Wolves had not been brilliant prior to the skull fracture that Jimenez suffered against Arsenal in November. And yet, their 2-1 win that afternoon meant that 10 games into the campaign, Nuno's side ended the month in seventh again, nevertheless. Four points off top.\n",

    "Image:The loss of Raul Jimenez was a huge blow for Nuno's Wolves project\n",
    "But the loss of Jimenez, scorer of 27 goals last season, proved insurmountable. Nuno toyed with four at the back in the knowledge that his forwards needed more support to make up the shortfall but that left the previously well protected defence exposed instead.\n",
    "There was further misfortune when Jonny suffered a recurrence of his cruciate ligament injury, while the absences of Willy Boly and Daniel Podence left Nuno short of options. The small squad that had somehow battled its way through a 383-day season began to creak.\n",
    "There were missteps too. The decision to rest players for a winnable FA Cup tie against Southampton frustrated supporters and the loan signing of Willian Jose has not worked out.\n",

    "But insipid defeats to Tottenham and Everton since then have underlined the sense that Wolves are a team meandering. The rebuild looks a long one and though Nuno has had time to plan for what comes next, any sense of clear direction has not yet appeared.\n",
    "The decision to part company renders such discussion moot now. What happens next is a problem for another coach. Nuno can embrace the return of 4,500 supporters for the game against United on Sunday without having to worry about any of that.\n",

    "He will enjoy the opportunity to experience just a taste of their enduring admiration one last time, maybe even affording himself another air-punch of delight in front of the South Bank.\n",
    "Whatever the result at the weekend, he will leave Wolves with a better win percentage than even Stan Cullis, the man whose statue stands outside the opposite end of Molineux.\n",
    "Needless to say, he will also boast a better win percentage than any other manager since Cullis brought three league titles and two FA Cups to the city between 1949 and 1960.\n",
    "Nuno did not come close to that but he did restore pride in the pack and elevate Wolves to a level that they will now hope to stay. He surely will, his reputation undoubtedly enhanced through a four-year reign that no Wolves supporters will wish to forget.\n",
